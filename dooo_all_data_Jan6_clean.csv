author,title,url,date,textJim Groom,"How ""open-source"" is Sakai?",http://bavatuesdays.com/how-open-source-is-sakai/,9/13/2007,"Yesterday I had the privilege of heading down to the University of Virginia and catching up with Steve Stedman and crew who are strongly considering piloting a WordPress Multi-user installation for their ITC group. We talked a bit over a Mexican lunch about Content Management Systems in general (Patrick turned them on to Drupal, and I even got to talk Typo3 with the other Steve). It was extremely enjoyable and one of the topics that came up is UVa's impending campus-wide move to Sakai, which I believe will be happening slowly over the next couple of years (the switch will be complete sometime in 2009). They have a pilot in the works called Collab, and in the afternoon show-and- tell session Patrick and I got to take a look at the inner-workings of Sakai for the first time.  It was pretty eye-opening in many regards. First and foremost, I have to be honest and say that I was pretty underwhelmed with Sakai. Steve and company did an excellent job skinning their install and, in fact, it immediately looks like a very inviting environment. But once inside, it seemed more like a labyrinth than a manageable tool for authoring and sharing resources quickly and easily online. I was surprised to find that Sakai, much like many of the proprietary course-management systems, fell prey to building their own applications such as the wiki, the blog, chat, forums, etc. None of them seem particularly stellar, and in fact many of them are admittedly sub- standard?specifically the blog. With all the thought, time, and money put into Sakai, you would think they would have realized that pulling the best of breed applications into this course management tool would be the way to go.  In fact, some of the UVa folks were excited about the feature that embeds websites using iframes into one's own Sakai space (I believe they referred to it as links). While this may have some value, I think the integration of these sites is a bit tenuous at best. All that is really happening is that you are embedding another web page into Sakai -so you can't really ""run"" Moodle or WordPress in Sakai, you can simply allow users to link them into the workspace. Making Sakai work as a kind of ""centralized browser"" of sorts. The problem with this is accessibility and the user interface. As we went through the demo of Sakai, the problems of navigating through the frames became readily apparent. Steve pointed out the issues here with the frames dis- orientating the user and how the system itself often has a series of ""false homes"" that can trap the user in a loop of sorts.  More than anything else, however, I was extremely disappointed with the limited RSS capabilities. You would think that an open CMS would have the RSS flowing like wine, and folks could have the option to hook in to one another's content making for a community of rich syndication much like the feed-based architecture that Jon Udell discussed recently here. However, nothing doing from what I have seen. The one RSS feed I was able to see was for the wiki, and it seemed to have problems distinguishing between particular project pages. Making it effectively useless.  On top of this, the URI (or URL) for a particular user's space is a long chain of undecipherable characters, making navigating to a site or sharing a link cumbersome?effectively hiding even open pages within a course. So radically different from the beauty of dynamic sub domains in WPMu, which in many ways may make all the difference for ease of navigation and the true feeling of each user having their own space on the web.  Now, truth be told, all these issues should be fixed, if not immediately, then at least eventually because the source code is open and folks can share extensions, work-arounds, etc. However, it may be open-source in theory and name, but given that it is primarily written in Java, I'm not sure how quickly Sakai will see any of these improvements. Perhaps for big, rich institutions like UVA putting Java developers on the scene can allow them to incorporate these improvements for the general community. Put even big, wealthy schools have definitive budgets, and a crack Java developer is both expensive and increasingly rare, making the open source ideology ring somewhat hollow. For at its root, open source, at least for me, has become so deeply associated with the ease of contributing to a code base.  Steve brought up several excellent points during the conversation, but I will focus on one in particular. Steve suggested that one of the possible dangers of a system like Sakai is that it is quickly becoming the flag-ship open source course-management system for many big research institutions, but with the community of contributors defined so narrowly to Java developers, at what point might open-source solutions suffer as an alternative for high-level administrators throughout education if Sakai doesn't live up to its promise? Which in my mind is a definite possibility. A host of research universities threw millions of dollars at an idea of an open source application, but they did it in a traditional academic way which put the idea and the perceived needs before the actual community and real needs. Now, I firmly believe that the theoretical and abstract conceptualizations of academia is the manna of so many great things, but I am not so certain that this is the case for open- source course-management systems. In fact, I think projects like Drupal, WordPress, MediaWiki, etc., capture a vibrant community because the details are being imagined and re-worked as the applications evolve. The communal evolution doesn't precede these systems existence, it defines it -a key difference from the organizing logic of a system like Sakai as I see it.  But, I am sure I'm overlooking, simplifying, or mis-representing several important elements of Sakai. I would love to hear about all the functionality that I have not seen yet, but I'm still a bit scared there is no there there.  "Jim Groom,Importing a single WP blog to a WPMu Installation,http://bavatuesdays.com/importing-a-single-wp-blog-to-a-wpmu-installation/,3/4/2008,"As promised, I am going to go through the steps I followed bringing this blog from a single WordPress installation into a WPMu environment. For some background on all of this check out these posts here and here.  So, I mentioned previously here just how unhappy I have been with the WordPress import and export functions. Not only is the importer inconsistent, but it also creates quirky XML that isn't as clean as it should be and imports only some of your precious data, while leaving out the blogroll, plugin tables, and a variety of other necessities germane to an export/import tool. These issues led me to experiment with importing the actual database tables of an existing single-installation of WordPress into a WPMu database. It wasn't all that hard, but there might be a few things to keep in mind as you give it a shot.  But before we get started there is one disclaimer: If you don't back up all your databases and core files for both your single WP and WPMu installs before trying anything like this, then you're a crack baby!  Let us go, nowƒ  Step 1: Export Your Single WP Installation Database  First thing you need to do is go into your CPanel and look for the phpMyAdmin interface on your server (this is my GUI of choice because I am line-command impaired) and export a copy of your WP single installation database. This is pretty straight-forward, just find the database for your blog, if you have several WP blogs set up and don't know which is which, then browse the wp- options table and you should see the blog title listed in this table (see example here).  Click on image for larger version.  Also, be sure to save the file you your disk so we can open it up and start changing a few things.   Step 2: Open Up the Exported SQL file in a Text Editor  Open up the SQL file you downloaded in a text editor of some kind. Keep in mind that if you choose the .gz format (a compression algorithm which is quite useful for large SQL files) you will have to double-click on the file to de- compress it before you start editing. If you use a Mac I recommend TextMate ($) or Text Wrangler (Free), and while the editing we will be doing to the .SQL file is very basic, the searching, finding, replacing of text and general formatting options will be easier with a good editor. As for PC based text editors, I'm not so sure, some good recommendations anyone?  Click on image above for larger version.  Step 3: Explanation of WPMu database table structure     The WPMu Tutorials site has two posts about the basic structure of the WPMu database. It is a useful overview that explains how the deafult blog in a WPMu database has the table prefix `wp1 ` as logic would have it the next blog you create on a WPMu installation will be `wp2` etc. This is a different from a single WP installation in that the single installation only has the wp prefix without the numbers (which connote a blog id in WPMu). For example, whne importing my single installation in WPMu, I already had several blogs within that environment, so when I mapped the new domain for bavatuesdays, the database table structure was already up to 30:  `wp30options` is the table name on WPMu vs. the `wpoptions` that is in my single installation. So, in short, just about every database table you have in a single WordPress installation (which will not include plugin databases only you have already set them up on the new WPMu blog you are importing to) will have a corresponding table in WPMu with an appropriately number table prefix, in my case `wp30`  Step 4: Editing the SQL database file  Before we go in and change the table names, one thing you might consider is cleaning out some on the kipple in your database. For me, this amounts to getting rid of all the spam caught by Spam Karma 2, and deleting the <code>sk2blacklist</code>, <code>wpsk2logs</code>, and anything else that takes up a lot of unnecessarily table space. For example, the 404 error log I run on my site (which is a plugin as is SpamKarma 2 and if they are not installed on your site they will not see these tables, and chances are your database will be far cleaner and lighter than mine is).  As for deleting database tables from an SQL text file, it is pretty simple because SQL files a very specific format that you can easily follow in a text document, here is an example:  `  -- --------------------------------------------------------`   ?    ?  Table structure for table `wpwmlayers`   ?   CREATE TABLE `wpwmlayers` (  `id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL autoincrement,  `layertitle` tinytext NOT NULL,  `layername` tinytext NOT NULL,  `layertype` tinytext NOT NULL,  `layerurl` mediumtext NOT NULL,  `layerparams` mediumtext NOT NULL,  `layerbounds` mediumtext NOT NULL,  `layeroptions` mediumtext NOT NULL,  `layersize` mediumtext NOT NULL,  `layerunavailable` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default ï1',  `layerhide` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default ï1',  `rsscachetime` mediumint(9) NOT NULL default ï0',  `layerauthor` bigint(20) NOT NULL default ï0',  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`)  ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTOINCREMENT=1 ;   ?    ?  Dumping data for table `wpwmlayers`   ?    ?   ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?   ?    ?  Table structure for table `wpwmobjects`   ?   CREATE TABLE `wpwmobjects` (  `id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL autoincrement,  `objectname` tinytext NOT NULL,  `layername` tinytext NOT NULL,  `objecttype` tinytext NOT NULL,  `objectbounds` tinytext NOT NULL,  `objectcolor` tinytext NOT NULL,  `objectwidth` tinytext NOT NULL,  `objecthide` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default ï1',  `objectauthor` bigint(20) NOT NULL default ï0',  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`)  ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTOINCREMENT=1 ;   ?    ?  Dumping data for table `wpwmobjects`   ?    ?   ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  As you can see from the two example of seaparate database tables above, SQL has a very regular logic to how it separates tables with hasmarks, and creates new tables, and populates the relevant information. So, having no knowledge of SQL, which is my current state, i just got rid of the tables that were extraneous (like Spam Karma and the 404 Error log) and renamed all of the wp prefixes to wp30 etc. for examples, the two tables above would no longer be `wpwmlayers` and `wpwmobjects`, but rather `wp30wmlayers` and `wp30wmobjects`. I didn;t have to edit any of the actual SQL code, but just rename the tables that are being created to match the blog id on WPMu. Does this make any sense?  Step 5: A quick find and replace all for table names  So, the quick and easy way to do this replacement is to use the text editor to find `wp and replace all instances with `wp30  This should do the trick, but this is also why it is very important to do a database backup of both installations just in case something goes wrong. Also, if anyone out there who knows more about SQL than me, and there are millions of you, pleeeeeeease peer review this post ??  Save the SQL file and now we move to deleting the existing tables for this blog in WPMu and importing the ones from the modified SQL file we have been working on.  Step 6: Deleting existing tables   The sixth step may seem counter-intuitive (and there may be a better way), but in my limited experience I found I had to go into the WPMu database and delete all the tables for the blog I created and want to import the single-install database to. For example, the new blog on WPMu for bavatuesdays has the database prefix wp30 (your may very well be different depending on how many blogs you have created and what the corresponding number is). So, I go into my WPMu database, find all the tables that have the prefix wp30 and drop them (scary I know, but trust me, I'm an amateur).  Please note: You will need to dump all of the tables associated with the blog you want to import. Try not to be confused by my example here because I have already done this and some tables are related to plugins. for a list of the tables you should be deleting with only the wp# prefix, for example:  wp#categories  wp#comments  wp#link2cat  wp#links  wp#options  wp#post2cat  wp#postmeta  wp#posts  wp#terms  wp#termrelationships  wp#termtaxonomy  Where the # is the number of the blog you have created to which you will be importing the SQL file. Am I being clear here?  As another note, wp#terms, wp#termrelationships, wp#termtaxonomy are all specific to WP version 2.3, so be sure your blog is updated to the lastest version before you try this!  Step 7: Importing the new SQL blog database   Once you have dropped all the relevant tables, you will then go to the import tab in phpMyAdmin and upload the modified SQL file we have been working through. This should be relatively painless, return to the root of the wpmu database, make sure you are not within a specific table, and then click on the import button, find the saved SQL file we have been modifying and import it.  And that should be it, but let me say two things before I end this post:  a) I'm a hack and this worked for me, but may prove unsuccessful for you, so if you try it please backup your stuff  b) I hope far smarter than me who have done this before and know the intricacies better will chime in and correct any flagrant errors or misleading passages that could mislead or somehow screw someone's attempts up.  With that said, go to it and let me knwo if you have an issues that I can try and help out with.  "Jim Groom,"High School Hell Cats, and other assorted mashup learning resources from the Internet Archive",http://bavatuesdays.com/high-school-hell-cats/,4/7/2008,"I find myself constantly going back to the Internet Archive, and constantly being blown away by what I find. Now, maybe I am biased towards video, and obsess over all things film history. I have been registering several people's interest in mashups from various angles, Doug Symington was wondering about the curricular possibilities here and Tony Hirst imagines through the process of finding resources here. I believe some of the more immediate brewing interest comes in the wake of Brian' Lamb's masterful presentation at the NMC Mashups Symposium (or as Samuel Beckett might say, in the wake of the Wake). A presentation that both Alan Levine and Chris Lott do an excellent job of framing here and here. More recently (as in this morning ?? ) I discovered randy Thornton's post about ""The Adventures of Bollywood Blackboardwala,"" a great series of short videos that use subtitling to turn these Bollywood clips into a hilarious narrative about BlackBoard's draconian business practices. Very fun stuff.  So, with mashups in the air, I do what I always do, return to the Internet Archive and find resources I want to mashup, but never get around to  ? but this will change! The other night while thinking through a project I will be working on with a forward thinking Italian professor, I came across over 100 classic film trailers on the Internet Archives in the SabuCat Movie Trailers Collection. And, I had a ball, I found the original, hi-resolution version of the High School Hell Cats trailer (a version of which is linked to above on YouTube). There was also the Babes in Toyland (1934) trailer  ?  a Laurel and Hardy classic for the ages which I always knew by the title March of the Wooden Soldiers. And then there's Attack of the 50 ft. Woman (1958), Double Indemnity (1944), Invasion U.S.A. (1952), the Harryhausen classic Twenty Million Miles to Earth (1957), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), and a truly bizarre trailer for a film I never saw (but I am dying to now) titled Baby Doll (1956), check out this trailer (and fair warning it is offensive on numerous levels).  So, given this list you might figure I'd said enough, and by all counts you would be right, ïcept my own. After watching a bunch of these trailers, I followed a link to the SabuCat Collection which promised over 60,000 film trailers. When I got there I realized that they were a business that offered high-resolution transfers from 35mm prints of thousands of movie trailers. I was a bit disappointed, figuring I had just hit the online movie trailer El Dorado.  Yet, all was not lost, for there was some interesting information I found on the site that made the trip out of the Internet Archive a bit less distressful to my psyche. Namely the following copyright information regarding movie trailers that I was unaware of:  > Can I use Trailers without being concerned over Copyright? Within certain limits, yes. Here's the storyƒ  >  > Trailers for movies released before 1964 are in the Public Domain because they were never separately copyrighted. The law at the time granted the owner 28 years to file a copyright registration.  >  > 1963 + 28 = 1991  >  > Clearly, time has run out to register this material. Some might argue that since the trailers frequently contain the same material that's in the movie, and the movie is presumably copyrighted, that this would cover the trailer as well. However, the trailer is published (run in a theater) before the movie itself is published. Thus, the trailer requires a separate copyright, and the scenes contained in the trailer are in Public Domain.  >  > Note that all trailers, regardless of year, until the late 80's, are O.K. to use if they contain no copyright notice. This does occur, although infrequently. For example, the trailer for ""The Shootist"" (John Wayne, 1976) contains no notice. It is therefore O.K. to use.  According to the couple that runs SabuCat, a majority of the trailers for movies made before 1964 are in the public domain. That's a lot of film footage free to be mashedup by the people. Moreover, if a film up and until the late 1980s doesn't have a copyright notice it is free to use, I wonder if anyone has done the research to find out which films since 1964 have the copyright notice, and which one's don't.  So, it seems like there is a tremendous amount of footage out there pre-1964 9and otherwise) that is free for the mashing up. Now that's Open Education!  Now it's time to work on a presentation for Faculty Academy 2008 (inspired by DJ Lamb) that tries to imagine how faculty might use these resources, which means I get to play and have fun  ? thanks go to Brian for the inspiration and Martha for the license!  "Jim Groom,"This ain't yo mama's e-portfolio, part 2",http://bavatuesdays.com/this-aint-yo-mamas-e-portfolio-part-2/,5/8/2008,"So, in an attempt to galvanize my mania to its most chaotically productive for Faculty Academy 2008, I'll go on with this e-portfolio madness, as promised. However, the comments on part 1 are already making me wonder whether this post shouldn't be written by D'Arcy, Chris, Phaedral, or Cole (or perhaps all of them)?  That acknowledged, I want to particularly note Chris and Phaedral's comments about the importance of each individual controlling the sequential nature of their portfolio, giving them full control over this nuanced space for extensive creativity, expression, and order. I couldn't agree with either of them more, and hopefully some of what I suggest below will point in that direction, but by no means put to rest the challenges and demands of such important caveats, and one can only hope for meaningful serendipity.  Ok, no more backsliding, avanti! The examples below will be centered around the work we have been doing at UMW with WordPress Multi-User (much of what I discus below can surely be done with Drupal and Movable Type  ? and probably several other applications I don't know about), but this is my blog and I ain't going to talk about those hippie applications anymore, ya hear?  Good.  An Example of a blogfolio?  Robert Lynne, a graduating Art major at UMW, will be my example for this post. I hope he can forgive me constantly harassing him, but his blogfolio (to quote D'Arcy) is a model of at least one way you can imagine the portfolio logic working. Rob has used his blog for several classes, an Art History course, an Art Studio course, a Sculpture course, as well as a Poetry Workshop course. He has had his blog for the 2007/2008 academic year, and the space demonstrates some of the questions of creative control, sequence, and serendipity that I mentioned earlier in regards to Chris and Phaedral's concerns.  In his blogfolio he chronicled his trip to NYC, helped shape a manifesto, blogged for classes, sang songs, and even had time to heckle yours truly. All of this was an on-going stream of ideas and thoughts that framed a process, being an art major he also had a lot of completed work to present to his audience, and this is where the use of pages on his blog became the space for what many might understand as a more traditional portfolio. He has a page dedicated to his paintings, sculptures, final thesis presentation, as well as a more focused about page. In these pages he controls the sequence, presentation, and obviously decides what goes in and what is left out. The space captures a fascinating part of both his creative process and experience throughout the year, but italso quickly became a space for him to represent the products of that process. He controls his space, he can delete my comments, delete his blog, or export the contents and take them somewhere else. In fact, there is no reason why he couldn't have done all of this on Blogger or WordPress.com. That said, I think the major reason he started it (but it probably was not the logic that ultimately drove it) was the fact that he was asked to blog for at least three different courses this academic year. Not all of which were in his discipline. I think the major reason his work branched out beyond the classes was that there was an audience, the UMW culture encouraged it, and he found it useful (at least to some degree) to frame his work and experience.  The Name of the Game is Spam-like Aggregation  The reason why blogs can be understood as more powerful, dynamic, and complex portfolio system is because of their Houdini like RSS ability. It really all revolves around the syndication infrastructure which makes all the difference, it affords flexibility, dispels the myth of a monolithic system, and allow for the more complex levels of filtering of content I will outline below. But for a portfolio system to work (and I think I feel the term portfolio falling apart right about now but bear with me) it has to be more than that. It has to be a space where people post there ideas for class, react to topics more informally, add resources about various issues they are thinking through (course related or not), and frame the academic work that they are amassing through their career as learners more generally. This is not a technological issue at all, this is a cultural one, and we have begun to see the beginnings of this at UMW (Roblog being an excellent example), but it is by no means ubiquitous, and there is much, much work to be done in terms of fostering the community to think about these elements together in a more orchestrated fashion.  One of the things about blogs more generally that have made this cultural leap a bit easier is that they are excellent at pulling together all the various online spaces a person may occupy and they are inherently open. Both of which allow for updates from Twitter or Facebook; embedding videos from YouTube or images from Flickr; providing extensibility for a wide range of multimedia and traditional site design. All of which forms a platform that is inviting for its protean ability to incorporate various media and one's distributed presence into one, simple space. This is key, and it is beautifully illustrated by an imagie engineered by Tom Woodward, which once I am able to annoy him enough to post it will be below as a big, beautiful illustration of this profound point, but geared to all you visual learners.  [ Imagine an image of an Octopus here with many loosely joined Web 2.0 tools ]  So, while Roblog is an excellent example, how does this make sense across a larger campus, and can you create both a culture and harness a simple enough technology process so that Roblog (and hundreds of other students) can easily blog for three or even six different courses during the year, while at the same keep it all on spaces they control yet share it as need be with the appropriate class. That is where the questions of filtering, aggregation, and a little bit of spam-blogging emerge.  Let me outline how this might at our current stage of development.  Thanks To Andre Malan's widgets BDP RSS Add Feed and Add Sidebar User, it is getting simpler all the time, but we still have to make a couple of more jumps. I'll outline them all below.  Leap of faith, I'm a professor and I ask my 25 student to get blogs (whether on UMW Blogs or elsewhere, it doesn't matter) and once the do to come back to my course blog and add their RSS feeds. This is made easy with Andre's Add Feed widget, for I can easily limit who adds a feed by the blogging community. So, once the student set up their space they can drop the feed in in the text field on the sidebar. Easy enough. But wha if they are using their blog for three diferent classes, a film hobby, and to document their Buffy the Vampire Slayer obsession? Well, then they could do one of two things, create a category for my class on their blog, lets call it bmoviemania, and if they are using WordPress (not sure how other blogging platforms handle category feeds) they can just add the RSS feed for that category like so:  http://myblog.com/category/bmoviemania/feed  Thereafter, everything they category as bmoviemania will be fed out to the course blog, keeping their Buffy posts and biology labs out of the b movie class blog (thanks goodness!). They could also do the same thing with a tag on wordpress, it would look like this:  http://myblog.com/tag/bmoviemania/feed  Now, we have a pretty straightforward method of taking these student blogs post for a specific course category or tag, and feeding them into an aggregated course blog. Now how does the aggregated course blog work? Well, it is much easier than it was a semester ago, but there is a little more automation that we need. (Warning: It gets a bit technical for the next few lines! But this information is not essential to the overall logic, so don't let it throw you off, it is me calling or help ?? ) The feed, once entered by the student, is immediately fed into the BDPRSS aggregator, this would need to be activated and the widget in the sidebar as soon as the professor creates this blog (any ideas Andre?).  Moreover, all the feeds that are fed into the BDP RSS aggregator would then have to be treated as an overall OPML which in turn is placed in the FeedWordPress plugin which actually taking all the posts from the respective student blogs and post them on this course blog (with the permalink pointing back to the students blog). Another automation needs to occur here, FeedWordPress needs to be automatically populated with the OPML feed from BDP RSS: http://bmoviecourse.com?bdprssfeed=1 The suffix will always be the same for this code, but the log domain, depending on the course will change.  So, save for two small bits of automation, we have a self-service aggregated course blog for aggregation, that allows all of the students responses, interaction, and posts to remain within their own space, while still capturing the logic of the course. A beautiful example of this is Gardner Campbell's Rock/Soul Progressive course from Spring 2008. One additional benefit would be an automatically generated blogroll from the list of students who entered their feed, possibly drawn from the URLs in BDP RSS.  Sorry for the programmistan talk, I hope feedistan isn't reading, but the larger point is that individuals now have their own space that they can grab the feed for, and even drill down and determine a feed for any given class with tags or categories, and then add it to a course aggregated blog.  But why all the talk about course blogs and aggregated such and such when this is about portfilios? Well, because I believe that this process is part and parcel of the archive/raw material that will ultimately populate this portolio. And as we saw with Roblog, the process is often just as relevant and important as the ñproduct.î This is also where the importance of community and the push for students to have their own space and create within their own Personal Learning Environment (their I said it), but alow it to be fed and captured within an aggregated course blog navigates liminal space between the increasingly irrelevant LMSs, and the free-for-all hippie PLEs ??  Also, think about what just happened with the course blog for a second. What was outlined there is now the basis of a publishing framework for an individual's portfolio that pulls from his/her blog archive of posts and class materials in a way that, like the course blog, they have the option to further tag or categorize the work in their personal archives that deal with all sorts of subjects, topics, experiences, and projects from their experience, and allow them to feed it into a site that reflects them in some way outside of the more conventional ideas of a blog (this would be available for UMW Bloggers and those who self-hosted ? not free, hosted solutions like wp.com, Blogger, etc.). Now some might be saying but why? The blog is them? And Roblog is an excellent example of this, so I don't necessarily disagree, yet the overarching archie blog may not be where they want to frame their work as a photographer, present lab work, field work, films, music, poetry, or business case study. The idea here is that anyone can choose how the fed out the relevant categories, that let's say are tagged with portfolio, and these spaces become more elegant and malleable presentation spaces for for particalar elements of their work wherein they control the sequence, aestheitc, and in many ways the experience of the visitor.  In many ways the is the aggregation/syndication infrastructure brought down to the human scale. yet, if you have students adding feeds to course blogs, why couldn't they do the same to directories, aggregated discipline channels, a Blogging platform hompage, or what have you. The fact that the syndication architecture is brought down to the atomic level of the individual, makes for the power of the site to scale more globally. More than that, the community will have a good sense of what it is they are doing and why!  I'll end here because it's three am, and a man's gotta sleep, but sometime tomorrow look for part 3 of This ain't yo mama's e-portfolio  Featuring: Biology Lab portfolios at UMW & an experiment with an English course using portfolios for anonymous assessment? Who knew?  "Jim Groom,A domain of one's own,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own/,11/29/2008,"Image credit: Olivander's Identity Crisis #4  It was recently announced by Mary Washington's new president that the next academic year (2009/2010) will be ""The Year of the Digital Campus"" at UMW. While I think we are uniquely positioned to make the most of this idea, I also wonder what it means exactly. But, in all fairness, I don't think anyone is entirely sure what it means just yet. Nonetheless, the Division of Teaching and Learning ? never short on ideas! ? recently sat down with UMW's new CIO to talk a bit about what it is we do, and during this discussion some possibilities were floated about next year's ""digital campus"" theme.  What we talked about was the idea of drawing attention to the importance of framing one's online identity in the 21st century. What could be more important for our moment than devoting a year to think about how we integrate the importance of a digital identity into the raison d'tre of a university? Not only to engage what it means for individuals within an academic community to both create and cultivate their online identity, but also how we might be able to actually help 4,000+ community members actually do it with relative ease?  Well, as you might have guessed, this is where UMW Blogs comes in ?? And while this is all thinking out loud at the moment, the idea of a campus wide campaign to think about the importance of a digital identity has me intrigued. Let's think about the question of digital identity on campuses presently, they are often associated with a campus email address or maybe a shared network space with some room for storing files and perhaps a meager webspace, the URL of which might look something like this:  `myschool.edu/community/people/~jdoe`  And while the idea behind the above web space for its community members might have been marginally useful for a while, I would argue that such space is completely useless for thinking about digital identities for our moment. How does this space enable easy authoring and integrating the various identities so many of us have around the web? Well, given the limitations of such a space, it can't provide much more than a hand-written HTML page with a few links and a flashing mail box ??  Moreover, the above URL is premised upon an individual's enrollment in a university or college, and when they leave that school this space will often disappear. A digital identity should be an online address one can have no matter where they are, a space where you can track that person as they move not only from being a freshman to a sophomore, but from an undergraduate to a graduate and beyond. An online home where they consciously integrate their professional profile through a streaming set of resources and spaces they inhabit online. To steal a concept from a recent comment by Gardner Campbell (who was quoting Doug Engelbart), an ""integrated domain"" flowing with traces of the work one does and the ideas they are exploring.  Now, in the case of UMW, we are in a situation where many of our students and faculty are using tools like blogs and wikis to trace the work they are doing, both as part of a course as well as independent thinkers. But, the URLs can often be dependent on a students fancy and remain couched within the domain umwblogs.org (such as jimgroom.umwblogs.org) which raises many of the same questions about persistence as the web space I maligned in the previous paragraphs ??  So, how might all this change if we actually purchased everyone on campus a domain for one year (at the tune of roughly $36,000) and framed the experience in such a way that all students, staff, and professors were able to easily setup and control their online identity through their own domain (something like jimgroom.net). One which they could take ownership of, maintain, and perhaps continue on with in some kind of perpetuity. I think UMW Blogs would be key to such an experiment because mapping a domain onto a blog is trivial (everyone could do it for themselves) and WordPress is an application that is ideally suited for syndicating fragmented resources from various spaces into a more comprehensive whole. Not to mention that this is a platform many within our community are already familiar with, which would allow us to bypass many of the technical and training concerns and enable us to focus on the conceptual importance of framing one's digital identity. As Brad Kozlek suggested recently in this post, ""[the] blog is a tool for students to craft their digital identity with intention."" The key here is the crafting of an identity with a purpose, the conscious consideration and creation of one's professional/academic identity online: a domain of one's own!  Jeff McClurken brought up some excellent concerns at our meeting last week, namely that if we are going to pursue such an all-encompassing enterprise, we had better be sure we have something to work towards academically so that it isn't interesting in idea alone, but actually is carried out in relationship to the work students are doing at UMW. I couldn't agree with him more in this, and I think that is where the planning and thinking comes into play, and the way I figure it we only have three or four months to make this a reality before the window of opportunity passes, so my thinking aloud here is to raise the questions and concerns so a model might present itself so that we can actually try what I think would be a pretty fascinating experiment.  If giving the entire campus a domain is too unwieldy, which I don't think it is given the omnipresence of UMW Blogs ?? , how about we focus on the incoming Freshman, and using this as a space where first year student's frame their academic lives at the university which I imagine would be centered around their research in the required freshman seminar.  "Jim Groom,The Last American Pirate,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-last-american-pirate/,12/4/2008,"Image Credit: ""It be a Pirate Flag"" by Nick Humphries  Update: Turns out this site was a hoax, there is no student, but rather a cadre of students who set about creating a fake student, who wrote a fake blog, and did fake research. For more information see this post by Mills Kelly, who engineered the hoax for the benefit of humanity more generally ??  Thanks to a tweet by Dave Lester and push to read it by Patrick Murray-John I found not only a really cool example of the power of these tools for an individual to track and frame their own educational experience, but some absolutely exciting research about a 19th century Pirate (possibly the last US pirate of his kind) no one's ever heard of: Edward Owens. This undergraduate took her research to the next level by framing the experience on her blog, full with images and details from her Library of Congress research, video interviews with scholars and her visit to Owens house, her bibliography, along with a link to the Wikipedia page she created for this little known local pirate.  What's even cooler is the fact that she not only framed a digital space for her research by getting her own domain and setting up a blog there, but she understood that she could also protect her identity at the same time by keeping certain information private. It is such a perfect example of the importance of framing your identity as a student/scholar online, and it really buttresses beautifully with the ideas we've been thinking about recently in regards to digital identity at UMW. More than that though, is the fact that this project was hers and she was fired up about what she had accomplished, and she could actually share that fact with others through her blog.  > This project has been a journey for me, not only as a student but as a historian. This may sound a little lame, but I am really proud of the work that I've done and how far I've come. I've learned a lot, not only about Edward Owens, but about the Chesapeake Bay during the late 1800's, the shipping industry, the U.S. Navy, etc. ( I could go on forever, but I'll spare you). I've also developed my researching skills. (Grad School here I come!)  "Jim Groom,Syndicatin' Welfare: UMW Blogs' Syndication Framework on the Cheap,http://bavatuesdays.com/syndicatin-welfare-umw-blogs-syndication-framework-on-the-cheap/,1/27/2009,"Can you you feel the bass and guitar kick in, and hear the tempo surely rise? I knew that you could!  > I know that it's evil  I know that it's got to be  I know I ain't doing much  Doing nothing means a lot to me  Living on a shoe string  A fifty cent millionaire  Open to charity  Syndicatin' welfare  Enjoy the rest here.  Everything you ever wanted to know about the state of syndication on UMW Blogs for the low, low price of my overdrawn prose. So lay it down and start kicking it up a notch?if you ain't syndicatin', you ain't vindicatin'!  Preliminaries  Here are the plugins and widgets you'll need for this syndication framework:     FeedWordPress Syndication plugin that is at the heart of the re-publishing posts from blog-to-blog. particularly when re-publishing a students posts in a course aggregating blog.    Sitewide Tags Pages Plugin This plugin automatically re-publishes all public posts from around your WPMu environment within a single blog. Which, in turn, gives you access to sitewide tag and categories feeds in one place, as well as a sitewide search of public posts. Note: only works with dynamic subdomains last I checked.    cetsEmbedRSS This plugin simply allows you to publish RSS feeds within a page or post without hacking the theme template (which until recently was a necessary evil).    Add Link widget This widget actually allows people to add a link to their own blog in the sidebar of another site, which automatically inserts their URL into the FeedWordPress plugin. So, effectively putting this on a course blog allows students to drop off their own feeds in the sidebar  I. Crux of the Syndication Hub: http://tags.umwblogs.org      UMW Blogs Tags blog  In many ways the Sitewide Tags Pages plugin is the glue that allows WPMu to act as a lightweight, yet powerful, syndication framework. Before this plugin came along both tags and category feeds were only available on a blog-by-blog basis, preventing the possibility of syndicating posts that shared tags or categories across numerous blogs. With this plugin all public posts are automatically re-published from across the site into one blog. Which results in an impressive step forward by allowing faculty and/or students to agree upon a unique tag or category for any given class, which in turn lets everyone in that course subscribe to one feed to see all the related posts. For example, if your class was on Prison Literature and everyone agreed that the course tag for related post should be prisonlit, then the following feed would aggregate all public posts with this tag from across the WPMu installation:  http://tags.umwblogs.org/tag/prisonlit/feed  If instead of a tag, the course agreed upon category such as prison lit,it would look like this:  http://tags.umwblogs.org/category/prison-lit/feed  Now, it is in conjunction with the Sitewide Tags Pages plugin that FeedWordPress plugin can become quite powerful. Once you have an agreed upon tag (or category), you can activate the FeedWordPress plugin and add the feed for a specific tag like prisonlit (http://tags.umwblogs.org/tag/prisonlit/feed) to an aggregating course blog. After that, every post published on the students blogs with that tag will be automatically re-published on this course aggregating blog. Additionally, all of the actual post title (a.k.a. permalinks) will link back to the students orginal post on their own blog. For example, in Susan Fernsebner's A Cultural History of Late 20th Century China course blog every students' post is being fed in through FeedWordPress by way of a unique, sitewide tag the class decided upon. Also, the title of each post links back to the actual student's blog. With such a setup the class members and professor can simply subscribe to the course RSS feed and have all the posts for that class delivered to their RSS reader through a single feed, and each of the titles within the reader will link back to the student's post on their own blog, rather than the course blog.  FeedWordPress Interface  What we have here is a lightweight, powerful mechanism for collecting posts from around the environment in one place and filtering them by tags and/or categories by means of the Sitewide Tags Pages plugin, while the FeedWordPress plugin allows for easy re-publishing of a filtered tag or category within a unique course space which results in a series of aggregated of posts relevant to the course.  II. Bring Your Own Blog  Now, what if you aren't blogging on UMW Blogs, what if your a Blogger baby or a WordPress.com commie or a Drupal droid? What if you are a roll your own kinda gal? Does this mean you are out of luck? Of course not, this is UMW Blogs after all, we don't discriminate, we just filter. And that is the kicker for me, so if you activate FeedWordPress on the actual sitewide tags blog ? or on any specific course blog ? you can simply add an external feed coming from another service (right now I have tested FeedWordPress with Blogger, WordPress, WP.com, TypePad, and Drupal ? all work cleanly) and the posts will syndicate into the course blogs cleanly with the relevant tags or categories. And if you activate and palce the Add Link widget in the sidebar of a course blog or the tags blog, students could simply drop off the URL of their own blog on some other site or service, and it would integrate smoothly. How about that? Is this eduglu?  Wants some examples of this? I have a couple.  Zach Whalen is hosting his courses on a Drupal installation he both designed and manages, it has some impressive features and the students all have their own spaces on a Drupal course site like this one. To bring the posts from this course into the UWM Blogs fold, all we need to do is add the feed for the Drupal course into the FeedWordPress plugin on the UMW Blogs Tag Site. That way, all the posts my the students on professor Whalen's site will be visible and searchable on UMW Blogs.  Another example is a student for professor Sue Fernsebner's Toys as History Seminar who came in with his own blog on WordPress.com. All prof. Fernsebner needs to do is add this feed to the Tags Blog using the Add Link Widget, and the post from WordPress.com would be automatically be re-published in UMW Blogs with the appropriate tag or category. Which leads me to the final section of this postƒ  III. There is more than one way to feed a course blog  Professor Fernsebner's Toys as History Seminar is an example of the fact that there are a number of ways to handle aggregating posts by students in a course blog. She is not using FeedWordPress for this seminar, and while all the students are still tagging their posts with a unique tag, they ar being fed into a separate page on her course blog using the cetsEmbedRSS plugin. So, if all the students are tagging their posts toysfsem, for example, she would simply activate the cetsEmbedRSS plugin, create a new page, and click on the RSS icon in the visual text editor.  cetsEmbedRSS  From there she adds the following feed: http://tags.umwblogs.org/tag/toysfsem/feed And all the posts tagged with toysfsem will be aggregated into this page, including the student blogging from WordPress.com whose feed was added to the UMW Blogs Tag site.  Additionally, you can simply activate the feedWordPress plugin and Add Link widget and have student drop off their feeds for where they are blogging.  Add Link widget  This can be useful for quickly collecting all the distributed blogs for each of the students, as well as providing a quick way to allow the aggregation to happen without too much time and effort spent on wrangling URLs. This method is being used by professor Rigglehaupt in a number of his course blogs, and as long as the students are aware they should only include the base URL for their entire blog if is dedicated only to this course, if it is being used for several courses they need to specify a unique tag or category feed for this course only and add the entire URL, something like this:  http://myblog.umwblogs.org/tag/amst350/feed  or  http://myblog.umwblogs.org/category/amst350/feed  And, what you have here is a self-service model for syndication, wherein the students become responsible for the feeds they add, and for actually thinking about the implications of writing for several courses from one space, as well as framing the site to work within these parameters. The thinking about the actual process of syndication, organization, and managing one's own space is actual a key feature to this entire model. I don't think it should be shied away from at all, but rather embraced.    IV. There can be no feeding without eating  As you might have gathered if you made it this far (you self-loathing hippie, you!), I've been trying to work through as many angles as possible with this stuff. This post is fodder for a bunch of documentation I will be building for faculty at UMW for creating syndication based courses on UMW Blogs. We have a surprising number of over 30 courses using some kind of syndication setup this semester, and it is high time we documented the hell out of it. I'll also note here that BDP RSS, the plugin that started me down the aggregation/syndication path, has been retired on UMW Blogs. The combination of cetsEmbedRSS and the Sitewide Tags Pages plugin made this plugin somewhat redundant, but to its great credit it hasn't been updated for over a year but still works fine in the latest versions of WordPress and WordPress Mu.  Finally, let me make a shameless plea for the plugin developers, particularly Donncha O Caoimh's Sitewide Tags Pages Plugin and Charles Johnson's FeedWordPress plugin ? which are the two key ingredients to this syndication framework at the moment. They could both use your support, I know Charles Johnson appreciates donations (and he has been on an insane tear developing this plugin as of late, it's just about perfect?at least until the next upgrade), and I imagine Donncha wouldn't mind a tip or even an extra hand developing out the plugin, looking for bugs, fixes, and generally giving back as much as one gets within the WPMu community. I keep thinking that the power of such a framework and third-party solutions can't remain ñfreeî for too long if we aren't building on each others work and pitching in as we can. Such a solution remains cheap 'cause we give back, and welfare means not being a glutton, for our ability to feed depends on others need to eat ??  "Jim Groom,bavacon or: How Blog Branding Ate My Soul,http://bavatuesdays.com/bavacon-or-how-blog-branding-ate-my-soul/,2/28/2009,"Image credit: ""Pittsburgh Comicon"" by RL Johnson.  Let me be frank here, I love the bava, I do, I love the little fucker. And I pretty much say whatever I want on it, and really could care less about the consequences. It's my little space to create and have fun, and I seldom, if ever, wield it as a hammer against others. In fact, that's not the logic of this space, if, indeed, there is one. I also don't brood over the blogging process, I write half-baked thoughts and let them die an ignoble death. That's an important element of this space for me because it is a liberation from my grad school days of writing?a period that's was a deep source of inadequacy and trepidation for me. I kind of think of the bava as an unlearning of that process, an intentional reaction to that prison house that I no doubt helped to create in my mind.  So, it's funny how this process has recently become a source of anxiety for me in other regards. Namely, the idea of ""creating a brand"" through my blog. I absolutely hate the idea of framing one's blog, online presence, digital identity, etc. as a brand. It is that very market-speak language of the web that robs it of any of its vitality. It makes what so many people are doing in this space for a wide variety of complex and conflicted reasons synonymous with some kind of consumer recognition bull shit. It turns these spaces about people, into a product-driven logic of statistics, rankings, and meager celebrity. It removes one from the very act of sharing and discourse that undergirds the power of such space. If we are using the term online branding to frame our conversations about institutions, personal blogs, or digital identities, then the apotheosis of people as product has been realized, and we might as well tattoo a bar code on our necks and get scan-inventoried at the local Wal-Mart. Resist market speak in education, fight the nefarious logic that seems to so innocently seep ? or is the proper green, bio-metaphor of the moment ""organically"" more appropriate here ? into a space that needs to remain ever vigilant about what the realities of markets do to any sense of community, culture, and camaraderie both to their own sense of mission, as well as for the culture at large they were designed to serve.  So, at this point in the post one might ask, ""Hey, bava, why all the preaching and teaching, hoss? Get to the punchline already."" Well, the punchline is that my own exhortation is born out of an ambivalence about what I have to say next. You see, ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,"" and I am capitalizing on this quote from Emerson to introduce an idea that has been bandied about on this blog in jest, and one which a quite persistent and rather funny blogger has been taking quite seriously. What I'm referring to here is bavacon. What the hell is bavacon? I don't know, I might blame Bryan Alexander for it via his throw away comment here, and I also might blame Steven Egan for taking my attempt to downplay the whole thing with a joke quite seriously. But when we get rid of the idea of bava from this equation, what Steven is talking about really fascinates me, and I will quote extensively from his post on the subject below:  > Might it be possible to arrange a digital conference thing with no physical location? A mash-up of sorts using different digital communication tools? AV chats, chat room discussions, feeds and more through a portalesque webpage to the individual locations? If needed I have a domain that would work well for this, and this goes right along with my plans for it. Unfortunately I don't have the hosting or know-how to do that, or I would.  ƒ.  First is the timing. With the economy problems, travel budgets are shrinking. The technologies to be used are easily accessible and widely varied. People are taking a serious interest in education and distance education. That interest is starting to wane due to other pressures. So, having a digital conference, possibly with a physical location, could start a wave of accessibility to learning conferences. With some interest in pushing the conference model into the Web 2.0 and other interests in improving conferences, now could very well be the best time for such an experiment  >  > Second is the draw. The Bava is a collection of creations by Jim Groom, who has plenty of contacts and could likely draw a crowd. That means the first event could be a big success. That would increase the chances of other conferences following suit. It also means that the word would spread, where if I were to try to do this there wouldn't be the draw to make it work.  >  > Third is the accessibility. Jim is a serious advocate of accessibility in learning, be it in tools, materials, opportunities or software. So I don't doubt he would try to make the Bavacon accessible to the masses. This also came out of a discussion on not being able to attend conferences and events, so it isn't just Jim's ideals. It's also the direction this thing started in.  >  > Fourth is the potential. This is where it becomes important. The timing of this could make this a big event in the learning circles. The draw of him and his contacts could add to the bigness of the event. An accessible learning conference would mean that teachers, educators, students and the masses could attend. Together that makes for a potentially huge event where students, teachers and policy makers can attend and possibly participate. Yet that is just the tip of the ice burg.  >  > Local viewings and discussions are a possibility. In a single chat room it is hard to deal with 50 or more people. Yet if you have up to around 20 people in a discussion it is entirely possible.  >  > Live and archived videos, twitter, RSS feeds, live and archived audio, chat rooms and live physical viewings or the video with discussion sessions afterward are all possibilities. That's all interaction and starting conversations.  The fact is, I think Steven is right about so many points, save the one where I might be the draw and impetus for such an event. What it could and should be is a collective happening that is distributed and would push a whole bunch of people to think about how we might be able to bring people together for a kind of focused learning party that is not dependent on geographic space. I think it would have to be an event for creativity and performance, not papers and research. We could synch our twitter accounts and watch films ""together,"" a model I saw here and thought was brilliant. We could get a venue in Second Life and perform our work ? I was inspired by NMC's Second Life conference ""Rock the Academy"" for the possibilities here this past November. We could create mashups, art, poetry and the like in a distributed space that syndicates into a site over the course of a specific period of time, and what elseƒ.? I don't know, the ideas would have to be generated by everyone, and would be a large part of why this would be valuable. Namely, imagining ways to create these personal and social communions online at specific times and places throughout the distributed web. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that it would have to be free, open, and archivable with everything that was created and captured made freely available with an open license. Moreover, it would take a number of people interested and able to make this idea a reality.  All that said, a large part of me would much prefer being in the same physical space with these people hanging out and talking and riffing about these things (hence WordcampFred). That said, I think this model of a focused, distributed event might make for an interesting opportunity for thinking through and innovating with the very technologies that might point the way forward in terms of alternatives. So, to that end I have this to say, I'll help Steven organize this if other people are see some potential value in it. The other condition is that we kill the name bavacon, let's call it abjectacon or infocultacon or con-a-punk or something like that. Moreover, perhaps this is happening already, and such an event may just seem like more work or duplicated effort ? something none of us need at this point. But I do know that I'd like to have something to work towards, and more times than not it's the usual presentation venue and form that isn't really pushing us to new ways of imagining how to share this stuff. That's what I am interested in with this push, what do you think?  "Jim Groom,Mozilla Open Education course,http://bavatuesdays.com/mozilla-open-education-course/,3/21/2009,"(Jan) Philipp Schmidt of Peer 2 Peer University has organized an open course (along with Mozilla and ccLearn) focused on designing the ""open educational platform of the future."" It's a great idea for a course (especially a free one!), and I was pretty excited when he asked UMW (by way of David Wiley- thanks David!) to talk about the thinking and execution behind UMW Blogs as one of the four case studies. You can read more about the course on Philipp's blog here and here, also the course wiki can be found here.  So, I was wondering how we might organize the process we went through thinking about and designing UMW Blogs, then I remembered we all blog here, so it should be rather easy. I was hoping Patrick would share his work imagining the Semantic elements of UMW blogs, and ask Andy to frame the possibilities for integrating digital media tools with such an open publishing platform. As for my part, I thought it might be useful to organize the posts that track my thinking about UMW Blogs over the last two years. To that end, I have created an organized lists of posts on the bava dealing with the development of UMW Blogs. It will be useful for me, if no one else, to have the occasion to actually go through and organize all this stuff in some relatively coherent manner so that others might be able to build on some of it or, even better, push past the limits of my thinking ? which are all too real. And given that Joss Winn has already signed-up for the class, I imagine I have more to learn from than share with this group given his recent intense and exciting thinking about WPMu in this post.  Anyway, here it goes, make the jump if you want to see an insane amount of links to all things UMW Blogs, WPMu, and me!  ### A UMW Blogs Reader  I. The conception  The following posts loosely trace the developing conception of UMW Blogs as an open, syndicated educational publishing platform. I think ""The UMW Blogs Story"" is an excellent overview, whereas ""One Tool to Rule them All"" and ""The Digital Five Ring Binder"" are early on in my thinking, and trace the seeds of thoughts that play out much more powerfully in the ""Permanent Revolution"" post as well as the ""Blog..I don't think that words means what you think it means."" The ""WPMu as Eduglu"" and ""Syndication Oriented Architecture"" posts are relevant here because they think through the conceptual model of a syndication framework to give people there own space while at the same time aggregating their work into a more centralized space easily and fluidly. Whereas the ""Open Education"" post is a bigger discussion of the relevance of something like UMW Blogs in the Open Education movement.     One Tool to Rule Them All: The Blog!    The Digital Five Ring Binder and Much More    Open Education: How do we build relevance?    WPMu as Eduglu?    Syndication oriented Architecture, or a Feed-Frenzied Framework     The UMW Blogs Story WordCampEd: Permanent Revolution    BlogƒYou keep saying that word, but I don't think it means what you think it means   II. Design   I actually think most of my posts are implicitly about a form of design in some way, a de-centered, loosely-coupled design, yet I'm not designer and I think my idea of this term has much more to do with architecture than aesthetics. That said, below are two posts where I take you through the design of the frontpage of UMW Blogs in its first (""Creating a dynamic frontpage for WPMu"") and second iterations (""New Digs for UMW Blogs, or the anatomy of a redesign""). The post ""WordPress: Power and Simplicity"" is an in-depth discussion about why the very design of WordPress makes it ideal for a loosely-coupled individual-based platform for teaching and learning. It examines the questions of control and authority inherent in both LMSs and CMSs, and suggests why a less control-driven system might be the new standard. Finally, ""The Design of Openness"" is my attempt to think through why I believe the very architectural design op WPMu makes it a key ingredient for openness in education, as opposed to the open source CMS model.

Syndication  There is a ton here, and I have spent much of the last two or three years trying very hard to cobble together a syndication logic that works. I m not a programmer, so this really depends upon finding the right plugins and tweaking them accordingly. The trajectory of syndication plugins went, at least for me, from WP-Autoblog (now defunct) to Wp-O-Matic (solid but a bit clunky) to FeedWordPress (what we are currently using). The posts below range from everything from conceptual thinking to very specific tutorials on these tools. If you don;t want to read it all ? and who could blame you ? I recommend ""Syndicatin' Welfare on the Cheap"" and ""The Revolution will be a Bus.""

Oh, My!    Syndicatin' Welfare: UWM Blogs' Syndication Framework on the Cheap     The Revolution Will be a Bus  IV. Domain Mapping   This is a topic I am truly fascinated by, and the idea that each blog within a WPMu installation can have its own, unique domain is so wild to me. The first six posts below are really tutorials and rough thinking about how this works and what it might mean. The final post, ""A Domain of One's Own"" suggests the larger possibilities for what it could mean for a University or college that wants faculty and students to begin thinking specifically about questions of digital identity.     Mapping Domains with WPMu    Multiple Domains on WPMu: Mission Accomplished    All Kinds of Domain Mapping with WPMu    WPMu Domain Mapping Plugin on CPanel    WPMu Subdomain Mapping    UMW Blogs has its first mapped (sub)domain A Domain of One's Own   V. Plugins  This is kind of random series of posts. I recommend WPMUdev and WPMu Tutorials for more specific plugins and tutorials, also Google is quite goo too ?? But I have blogged about so many plugins in so many different forms that I linked to a couple of summary posts that may or may not be useful. Searching for plugins is the fun part, so I would recommend you think of these resources as potential starting point, because discovering new plugins to make your life easier is key element of the adventure.     A List of WPMu Plugins    A List of Plugins Used on the Bava    WPMUdev.org (External link to a great resource for WPMu developers)    WPMU Tutorials (External link to some great tutorials for getting up and running with WPMu, as well as hacking along)   VI. Eportfolios  Quite frankly, I don't know what the hell an eportfolio really is, this was a series of three posts where I tried to spell out how we can begin re-thinking the eportfolio using WPMu as an example. And while I hate the term ""eportfolio,"" if you are interested in some other ways of imagining it these posts may be of some limited use.     This ain't yo mama's eportfolio, Part 1    This ain't yo mama's eportfolio, Part 2    This ain't yo mama's eportfolio, Part 3  "Jim Groom,An Integrated Domain,http://bavatuesdays.com/an-integrated-domain/,3/29/2009,"I have been thinking pretty consistently, but rather quietly about the idea of a domain of one's own. In fact, I'm starting to read Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own for several reasons, but one of them is for some fodder for a presentation on the idea I will be doing at Duke University at the end of April. In the mean time, I was experimenting with FeedWordPress yesterday (the latest version of which works flawlessly on UMW Blogs) and I have to say I am blown away by the way it pulls in feeds from all sorts of services above and beyond just blogs.  I wanted to see how it syndicated tags from del.icio.us, Flickr and YouTube, so I grabbed a vanity feeds from each of these services and ran them through FeedWordPress on one of my test spaces on UMW Blogs.  Here's the jimgroom tag on flickr:  http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photospublic.gne?tags=jimgroom?=en- us&format=rss200  And here's the jimgroom tag on YouTube:  http://youtube.com/rss/tag/jimgroom.rss  And here's the jimgroom tag on del.icio.us  http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/tag/jimgroom?count=15  They validated without an issue and, what's more, the stuff they pulled into the blog was rather attractive.  All of which means a UMW Blogs blog could serve as a way to aggregate and re- syndicate all the various places you live online, and the feed for which can provide links directly to all the the various syndicated services you are pulling in. Not to mention that you can filter your feeds from these spaces through tags making the whole thing that much more granular and malleable.  All this got me thinking about Joss Winn's ideas for the new Prologue theme P2, a Twitter-like theme for WordPress and that should be available for general consumption soon. With something like that within a community like UMW, people could actually feed out their activity from various spaces into a stream of campus consciousness. A feed from around the various web services you use (similar to Facebook's mini-feed or the activity feed in BuddyPress) but casting a far wider net in the services it can reflect. I think such a visualization of people's activity would prove far more personal and powerful than the links to recent posts that show up on the homepage of UMW Blogs as of now. One issue with this may be that FeedWordPress uses the title permalink as the means to go to the original resource ? need to test the possibilities here.  Anyway, just trying to think this stuff through, but this post is really just to say how happy I am with FeedWordPress these days.  "Jim Groom,"One blogƒor many? A Closer Look at ""American Technology and Culture""",http://bavatuesdays.com/one-blogor-many-a-closer-look-at-american-technology-and-culture/,3/29/2009,"Jeff McClurken and I have been working on a project for his History of American Technology and Culture course that I am pretty excited about. I'm digging this one in particular because it highlights some of the unique possibilities of building an exhibit of student research in WordPress Multi- User. But before I get started, I should note that this course has a long tradition of experimentation and that this incarnation is just the latest iteration in a long line of online presentations.  Jerry Slezak and Jeff have explored everything from Netscape Composer back in the day to MediaWiki last year. But we all knew that when I got my hands on this mother it would be WPMu time, right? Right. So let's proceed.  Here's the deal, there are 21 students in this class, each of which will be thoroughly investigating a technology of their choice. The range of which is fascinating, this year's group moves from the zipper to toilet paper to the mobile phone to global positioning systems (with a wide range in between). I love the array of technologies from various moments in American culture, it makes for a rich and complex understanding of the very idea of what a technology is and how it relates to our culture at any given moment. McClurken rocks! A number of years back everyone in the course would make their own Netscape Composer sites ? many of which were quite good. One of the issues with this approach ? beyond the fact that Netscape Composer is now outdated ? was that a wide range of different layouts and presentations often made it difficult to present and navigate the research as the larger product of a course. Although, it does preserve and present the individual's research project quite nicely.  More recently MediaWiki was used, and I think their were some improvements there, but for me MediaWiki is increasingly becoming a bear between spam, a lack of a user-friendly text editor, and a brand new formatting language ? however basic. In fact, I am more and more convinced MediaWiki is a technology of extremes?it is really only useful for huge projects with hundreds or thousands of participants, or just one. The middle ground is often far more work and maintenance than need be, and do feel free to fight me on this ? I'm feeling ornery and could use a good throw down. What's more, while getting one's own work out of MediaWiki isn't difficult, it's having your own MediaWiki to post it in that may prove impossible (and here's where a project like this in Wikipedia may be interesting?if not difficult). That said, it's easy enough to reformat a series of MediaWiki pages for a blog or straight HTML, but there is some additional work involved and we just added several more steps.  Given my sense of the limitations of these two options, and thanks to Jeff's willingness to experiment, I suggested we actually build the exhibit of student research in UMW Blogs with a customized theme. The logic is as follows; once each student selects the technology they will be researching, they create their own blog with the technology name in the subdomain. For example, a student researching the Birth Control Pill would create a blog along the lines of this URL: http://thepill.umwblogs.org/. After that, we make available a lightly hacked theme that every student in the class will use to provide a consistency of templates across the 21 students' research sites. As for the content, Jeff provided the class with specific guidelines outlining the aspects of the technology they need to research, and by formalizing these elements as pages within their own sites we came up with some rather simple steps for creating their site using this class-wide template (you can see them here) .  In other words, the 21 different students create their own blogs wherein they publish their research according to a specific format, they choose a common theme (which is lightly hacked) that creates and over-arching means of navigating the work of the entire class. The homepage is simply a blog Jeff created which contains the iconic images that link to each of the student's research, along with information about the contributors and an about page. What's nice about this is that each of the blogs are independently administered and created by the students, so they can export their work as they see fit, or even import it into another blog or portfolio space and organize and theme it as they want.  What's so cool about this in my mind is that it takes so little effort, I used slightly hacked K2 theme to give the sense of consistency amongst 22 different blogs, and the ability to move easily amongst the distributed research is powerful because the illusion of some kind of visual whole is preserved ? while the fact that it's an individual's own research that they control remains intact. The students' research and the exhibit site are still works in progress at this point, but it should be done within the next couple of weeks, and I'll probably be blogging it again. But, in the mean time, if anyone is interested in reading about the simple theme hacks I used to accomplish this, take the jump with the link below.  I stuck with K2 because I know it inside and out, and I still think the theme is rather elegant an simple in its layout, even if over-used. To make this theme a unique option within UMW Blogs, I simply put a new screenshot.png file in the theme with a shot of the new theme as well as added the following to the top of the styles.css file (what I added is in red):  / Theme Name: <span style=""color:red"">American Technology and Culture Class Theme</span> Theme URI: http://getk2.com Description: Configure from the <a href=""themes.php?page=functions.php"">K2 Options Panel</a>.

Now, the only hacks I used were in the header and CSS, I basically created an additional navigation bar in the top-left corner of the header that would show up for anyone that is using this specific theme. There are probably better ways to do this (and I would love recommendations) but I used Suckerfishes Multi-level Drop Down Navigation bar CSS generator. I actually only need one level, but I liked the drop down and that they created the CSS for me ? there is also an accompanying WordPress Plugin, but I didn't see the need for it with this hack.  So, I generated some CSS and copying it into the bottom of the hacked K2's Style Sheet (style.css). After that, I just tweaked it a bit, and while I'm sure I don;t need all of the CSS below, it was easy enough to generate and who am I to waste good CSS that I can't write:  #suckerfishnav { background:#333 ;

I abandoned this because when the drop down menu goes beyond the header and into the content area I could no longer click on the links?and it looked all weird. (Anyone know of a fix for this?) So, I decided to limit the featured technologies to five, and leave a ñView more hereî link as the sixth menu item. What I would like to do ? but it's actually beyond my abilities ? is to write a little PHP script that randomizes those five featured links from the 21 available links so that every time someone hits that drop down menu, five random technologies get linked to. Not sure how difficult this would be, and I may try to bother a few folks if time allows ? anyone have some pointers?  The other thing I did here is got rid of the link to the title of the blog in the header. I only did this because I already have an ñExhibit Homeî tab in the new navigation bar that brings users back to the homepage.  Well, that's just about it, all very, very basic hacks. I guess the only other one is the setup for the front page of the exhibit site which is jut a hacked template that gets rid of the sidebar and extends the content space from the 500px block on the left to the entire 780px space of the template. This was simple, I just created an alternative style for what K2 calls the #primary content area (I titled it #primary2) and added it to the styles.css file. The new style for this are looks as follows:  #primary2 { width: 780px; float: left; padding: 20px 0 10px; margin: 0 5px 0 5px; display: inline; }  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  #primary2 {  width: 780px;  float: left;  padding: 20px 0 10px;  margin: 0 5px 0 5px;  display: inline;  }  After that, I just hacked a new page template that looks like the following and selected that as the template for the front page of the exhibit site. It looks like this:  <?php / Template Name: No Sidebar / ?> <?php getheader(); ?> <div class=""content""> <span style=""color:red""><div id=""primary2""></span> <div id=""current-content""> <div id=""primarycontent"" class=""hfeed""> <?php while (haveposts()) { thepost(); ?> <div id=""post-<?php theID(); ?>"" class=""<?php k2postclass(); ?>""> <div class=""page-head""> <h2><a href=""<?php thepermalink() ?>"" rel=""bookmark"" title='<?php printf( ('Permanent Link to ""%s""','k2domain'), wpspecialchars(getthetitle(),1) ); ?>'><?php thetitle(); ?></a></h2> <?php editpostlink(('Edit','k2domain'), '<span class=""entry-edit"">','</span>'); ?> </div> <div class=""entry-content""> <?php thecontent(); ?> <?php linkpages('<p><strong>'.('Pages:','k2domain').'</strong> ', '</p>', 'number'); ?> </div> </div> <!-- #post-ID --> <?php } // End the Loop ?> </div> <!-- #primarycontent .hfeed --> </div> <!-- #current-content --> <div id=""dynamic-content""></div> </div> <!-- #primary --> <span style=""color:red"">Notice there is no getsidebar call here :)</span> </div> <!-- .content --> <?php getfooter(); ?>  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  <?php /  Template Name: No Sidebar  / ?>  <?php getheader(); ?>  <div class=""content"">  <span style=""color:red""><div id=""primary2""></span>  <div id=""current-content"">  <div id=""primarycontent"" class=""hfeed"">  <?php while (haveposts()) { thepost(); ?>  <div id=""post-<?php theID(); ?>"" class=""<?php k2postclass(); ?>"">  <div class=""page-head"">  <h2><a href=""<?php thepermalink() ?>"" rel=""bookmark"" title='<?php printf( ('Permanent Link to ""%s""','k2domain'), wpspecialchars(getthetitle(),1) ); ?>'><?php thetitle(); ?></a></h2>  <?php editpostlink(('Edit','k2domain'), '<span class=""entry- edit"">','</span>'); ?>  </div>  <div class=""entry-content"">  <?php thecontent(); ?>  <?php linkpages('<p><strong>'.('Pages:','k2domain').'</strong> ', '</p>', 'number'); ?>  </div>  </div> <!-- #post-ID -->  <?php } // End the Loop ?>  </div> <!-- #primarycontent .hfeed -->  </div> <!-- #current-content -->  <div id=""dynamic-content""></div>  </div> <!-- #primary -->  <span style=""color:red"">Notice there is no getsidebar call here :)</span>  </div> <!-- .content -->  <?php getfooter(); ?>  You'll notice above that the div id is actually primary2 not primary, which changes the width of the content area in K2. Also, you might notice I deleted the getsidebar PHP call which basically gives me the single page layout you see on the homepage of the exhibit here.  It may seem like a lot to some, but anyone who knows anything about code knows that this is the most basic of hacks, and that's what I like about it. It's dead simple, and the effect is rather powerful ? it's kind of like the Dude's rug, it really brings the room together.  "Jim Groom,"""Open is always outward facing""",http://bavatuesdays.com/open-is-always-outward-facing/,4/13/2009,"Last Wednesday I had a discussion with Philipp Schmidt, Ahrash Bissell, and Dave Humphrey for the second seminar of the Mozilla Open Education course. This discussion was designed to focus on four different case studies, but unfortunately Wayne Macintosh and David Wiley couldn't join us due to technical difficulties. So, the discussion was divided in half. Nonetheless, I hope it was a useful discussion for the participants, anyone interested can find the whole thing here (it's in Ogg Vorbis format). There were two highlights in particular that I would like to draw attention to.  First, it was my first introduction to Dave Humphrey of Seneca College, who was an absolute pleasure to listen to and converse with (although to my chagrin I kept referring to him as David, not Dave, throughout the discussion?sorry about that!). His class projects are brilliant, he teaches Computer Science courses wherein his students actually develop code as part of the Mozilla open source community. A re-aligning of a traditional course that makes the work his students do during a semester immediately relevant to one of the biggest?if not the biggest ? open source community in the world. You can read more about his project on Mark Surman's blog here and listen to an audio interview about the course here.  Second, Dave Humphrey said something at the end of the conversation that really resonated with me, so I am going to reproduce it below, as well as provide a link to his closing remarks which I have been mulling over for the last five days. When talking about this idea of open, Dave noted the following:  > Open is always outward facing, and so I think it's a losing battle to try and do it in an inward way. So if my goal was to convert all of my school to the same beliefs that I have about how you should teach and the way you should share, and all of that, I would never get there. So in some ways I have given up on institutional approaches to this, and I am much more focused on individual and community, and how that scales and we can connect those things.  You can hear the rest of this thread below:  Download Dave Humphrey in Mozilla Open Ed, Seminar 2  What struck me about this is the real tension that exists between institutional approaches to ideas of working out in the open and those of individuals who together might forge a community of openness both within a larger institution as well as across any institutional boundaries. A move away from thinking about the possibilities that the openness of the web brings to the future of education is not so much a process of changing the institution, but rather of fostering individual and communal in order to imagine the possibilities that lay fallow all around us. This is the very reason why I love the blogosphere and find it impossible to stop posting here. If I did, I'd become increasingly cut-off from a life-blood of vibrant thought that moves far beyond the confines of my institution ? and if I were limited to the current mood of my institution I'd probably have a loaded gun to my head.  I've often considered the work I have been doing at UMW as a way to change the institution, working to help the university realize the power and possibility of opening up to the world, and thinking about how the mission of a public university might re-imagine itself given the radical changes in the means and methods of publishing and sharing. Yet, institutions seem designed to disappoint, and the idea of such an overarching goal for imposing a vision of what open is on others who may disagree is just as problematic as institutions closing down on openness out of fear of engaging in public discourse that makes the work happening at any given campus increasingly transparent and relevant. What Dave's thoughts made me seriously consider (something I have desperately needed these days) is that what is at the heart of the work we all are doing is not about changing institutions, because if it were I would currently be paralyzed. It's about communing and sharing openly with others both within and beyond our institutions ? a push that limited to, or dependent upon, something like UMW Blogs or any other one tool, but rather on a series of personal commitments to thinking openly and honestly about what the future of education is and how we might take some meaningful steps in that direction.  So, to that end, I'll link to one more audio excerpt from this discussion wherein I define a DTLT project that moves in this direction of the individual as the site for re-imagining the future of education as part of a community. For the next year I will be committed to ""A Domain of One's Own,"" an idea that is not focused on the logic of the institutional infrastructure, but rather then individual's own cheap and simple space to both aggregate to and create from.  Download Excerpt from Seminar 2 on ""A Domain of One's Own""  "Jim Groom,None,http://bavatuesdays.com/start-with-the-demo-magic-trick/,4/21/2009,"I'll be giving a presentation this Friday at Duke University's Instructional Technology Showcase titled ""Fragmented Identities: A Domain of One's Own"" (the title is kind of a tribute to Duke's Literature department in the heady days of theory in the late 80s and 90s). But to counteract any pretense of being an academic, I've decided to modify Levine's Law of presenting a bit and rather than starting with the demo, I'm gonna start with a magic trick. That's right, I will be donning a cape, fake moustache, and a top hat for this one, but there will be no scantily clad assistant sawed in two, in fact my assistants will be anyone out there crazy enough to participate! In other words, I need your help, but it will be painless, I promise.  Here's the deal, I've set up a UMW Blog for this presentation here and come presentation time I plan on showing them this blank slate, and then asking anyone from the audience who is interested to share their feed. After about a minute or so, I will pull the switch and update the site via FeedWordPress, and whammo!?I'd like the site to be overflowing with posts, images, videos, etc., from a wide range of sites and services to re-enforce the power of blogs as aggregation points of our fragmented identities. I'm also hoping it might act as an immediate way to demonstrate in real time the logic behind UMW's syndication bus and the importance of RSS.  So, if you got a second, do me a favor and add a feed (or several) to the presentation blog here. There's a big ""Add feed"" here field in the top-right corner, you can't miss it. Also, it would be great to see feeds from a wide range of services like Flickr, YouTube, delicious, Blip.tv, Twitter, or whatever else you got.  "Jim Groom,UMW Blogs featured in EDUCAUSE's 7 Things for PLEs,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-blogs-featured-in-educauses-7-things-for-ples/,5/16/2009,"Yesterday I noticed (thanks to tweets from Jeff McClurken and Martha Burtis) that EDUCAUSE's ""7 Things You Should Know About Personal Learning Environments"" features the University of Mary Washington as one of the schools experimenting and fostering PLEs on a larger, campus-wide scale. In particular, they feature the possibilities for creating a personal learning environment through UMW Blogs. It's odd, but I've never really thought of UMW Blogs as a PLE or PLN ? and this is probably because I try and avoid these acronyms because the language seems so dessicated to me. However, I think there is some real truth to thinking about a blog space on UMW Blogs (or anywhere else) as an easy and supported way for entering into the larger conceptual idea of how the personal web can be traced, supported, and visualized from within an institution.  The biggest concern, however, is keeping it personal, and allowing folks to share what they are doing in their own spaces wherever they are, and intelligently feeding it back into the syndication bus. Leave the multitudinous options open, and don't lock them into a singular campus platform. Rather, use the classroom as a space to explore and learn through these tools, while resisting the urge to get comfortable with an ""enterprise solution"" for teaching and learning technologies. All that said, I was pretty excited to see UMW Blogs come up in the discussion, and I think the ""Domain of One's Own"" discussion we have been having here at UMW lately will really take this idea to another level for both the individual and the institutions (but particularly for the institutions ? for they will be asked to let go of an outdated way of thinking that is fueled by the anachronistic logic of the LMS!).  "Jim Groom,"DUKE CIT Presentation: ""Do you believe in magic?""",http://bavatuesdays.com/duke-cit-presentation-do-you-believe-in-magic/,6/25/2009,"Looks like the good folks at Duke University's Center for Instructional Technology put my presentation ""Fragmented Identities: A Domain of One's Own"" up on YouTube. Quite frankly, I was afraid to watch the video because I have fond memories of the talk, and on a partial viewing my fears were confirmed ? -I was all over the place, a complete mess really. The one thing I do like about it, however, is just how vernacular my style is. It's such a long way from the days of presenting my grad school papers, and while it make be dreadfully imprecise and off-the-cuff, I also feel like it is far more intimate and personal ? just like so many of these technologies we are trying to think through.  The magic trick comes at the 11:30 mark, and my early discussion of Twitter is kind of fun, although the Twitter stream during my session never really took off. Anyway, here it is, another presentation experiment that was in many ways a failure, but at the same time an attempt.

American Council of Learned Societies,  Our Cultural Commonwealth, 2006  Sometimes progress is linear. Sometimes progress is exponential: according to the durable Moore's Law, for example, computing power doubles about every two years. Sometimes, however, progress means looping back to earlier ideas whose vitality and importance were unrecognized or underexplored at the time, and bringing those ideas back into play in a new context. This is the type of progress needed in higher education today, as students, faculty, and staff inhabit and co-create their online lives.  The early days of the web in higher education involved workshops on basic HTML, presentations on course web pages, and seed money in the form of grants and equipment to help faculty, staff, and occasionally even students to generate and manage content in those strange ""public.html"" folders that suddenly appeared on newly connected desktops. These days were exciting, but they were also difficult. Only a few faculty had the curiosity or stamina to brave this new world. Staff time was largely occupied by keeping the system up and running. And few people understood how to bring students into this world, aside from assigning them e-mail addresses during orientation.  Then an answer seemed to appear: template-driven, plug-and-play, turnkey web applications that would empower all faculty, even the most mulish Luddites, to ""put their courses online."" Staff could manage everything centrally, with great economies of scale and a lot more uptime. Students would have the convenience of one-stop, single-sign-on activities, from registering for classes to participating in online discussion to seeing grades mere seconds after they were posted. This answer seemed to be the way forward into a world of easy-to-use affordances that would empower faculty, staff, and students without their having to learn the dreaded alphabet soup of HTML, FTP, and CSS. As far as faculty were concerned, the only letters they needed to know were L-M-S. Best of all, faculty could bring students into these environments without fear that they would be embarrassed by their lack of skill or challenged by students' unfamiliar innovations.  But that wasn't progress. It was a mere ""digital facelift""  ?  Clay Shirky's phrase for the strategies that newspapers pursued in the 1990s when they couldn't ""think the unthinkable"" and see that their entire world was about to change.1 Higher education, which should be in the business of thinking the unthinkable, stood in line and bought its own version of the digital facelift. At the turn of the century, higher education looked in the mirror and, seeing its portals, its easy-to-use LMSs, and its ""digital campuses,"" admired itself as sleek, youthful, attractive. But the mirror lied.  Then the web changed again: Google, Blogger, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. The medium is the message. Higher education almost completely ignored Marshall McLuhan's central insight: new modes of communication change what can be imagined and expressed. ""Any technology gradually creates a totally new human environment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes. . . . The 'message' of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs.""2 Print is not advanced calligraphy. The web is not a more sophisticated telegraph. Yet higher education largely failed to empower the strong and effective imaginations that students need for creative citizenship in this new medium. The ""progress"" that higher education achieved with massive turnkey online systems, especially with the LMS, actually moved in the opposite direction. The ""digital facelift"" helped higher education deny both the needs and the opportunities emerging with this new medium.  So, how might colleges and universities shape curricula to support and inspire the imaginations that students need? Here's one idea. Suppose that when students matriculate, they are assigned their own web servers  ?  not 1GB folders in the institution's web space but honest-to-goodness virtualized web servers of the kind available for $7.99 a month from a variety of hosting services, with built-in affordances ranging from database maintenance to web analytics. As part of the first-year orientation, each student would pick a domain name. Over the course of the first year, in a set of lab seminars facilitated by instructional technologists, librarians, and faculty advisors from across the curriculum, students would build out their digital presences in an environment made of the medium of the web itself. They would experiment with server management tools via graphical user interfaces such as cPanel or other commodity equivalents. They would install scripts with one-click installers such as SimpleScripts. They would play with wikis and blogs; they would tinker and begin to assemble a platform to support their publishing, their archiving, their importing and exporting, their internal and external information connections. They would become, in myriad small but important ways, system administrators for their own digital lives.3 In short, students would build a personal cyberinfrastructure, one they would continue to modify and extend throughout their college career  ?  and beyond.  In building that personal cyberinfrastructure, students not only would acquire crucial technical skills for their digital lives but also would engage in work that provides richly teachable moments ranging from multimodal writing to information science, knowledge management, bibliographic instruction, and social networking. Fascinating and important innovations would emerge as students are able to shape their own cognition, learning, expression, and reflection in a digital age, in a digital medium. Students would frame, curate, share, and direct their own ""engagement streams"" throughout the learning environment.4 Like Doug Engelbart's bootstrappers in the Augmentation Research Center, these students would study the design and function of their digital environments, share their findings, and develop the tools for even richer and more effective metacognition, all within a medium that provides the most flexible and extensible environment for creativity and expression that human beings have ever built.  Just as the real computing revolution didn't happen until the computer became truly personal, the real IT revolution in teaching and learning won't happen until each student builds a personal cyberinfrastructure that is as thoughtfully, rigorously, and expressively composed as an excellent essay or an ingenious experiment. This vision goes beyond the ""personal learning environment""5 in that it asks students to think about the web at the level of the server, with the tools and affordances that such an environment prompts and provides.  Pointing students to data buckets and conduits we've already made for them won't do. Templates and training wheels may be necessary for a while, but by the time students get to college, those aids all too regularly turn into hindrances. For students who have relied on these aids, the freedom to explore and create is the last thing on their minds, so deeply has it been discouraged. Many students simply want to know what their professors want and how to give that to them. But if what the professor truly wants is for students to discover and craft their own desires and dreams, a personal cyberinfrastructure provides the opportunity. To get there, students must be effective architects, narrators, curators, and inhabitants of their own digital lives.6 Students with this kind of digital fluency will be well- prepared for creative and responsible leadership in the post-Gutenberg age. Without such fluency, students cannot compete economically or intellectually, and the astonishing promise of the digital medium will never be fully realized.  To provide students the guidance they need to reach these goals, faculty and staff must be willing to lead by example  ?  to demonstrate and discuss, as fellow learners, how they have created and connected their own personal cyberinfrastructures. Like the students, faculty and staff must awaken their own self-efficacy within the myriad creative possibilities that emerge from the new web. These personal cyberinfrastructures will be visible, fractal- like, in the institutional cyberinfrastructures, and the network effects that arise recursively within that relationship will allow new learning and new connections to emerge as a natural part of individual and collaborative efforts.  To build a cyberinfrastructure that scales without stiflling innovation, that is self-supporting without being isolated or fatally idiosyncratic, we must start with the individual learners. Those of us who work with students must guide them to build their own personal cyberinfrastructures, to embark on their own web odysseys. And yes, we must be ready to receive their guidance as well.

"Jim Groom,Day 107: Playskool McDonald's Set,http://bavatuesdays.com/day-107-playskool-mcdonalds-set/,9/10/2009,"While the liberal media has killed the beauty that is McDonald's over the last decade, I remember a day during the 1970s when McDonald's wasn't poisoning the underclass and undermining all that is good and right about the unaffordable organic food movement. McDonald's will never simply be just another chain burger joint, McDonald's was a ""familiar place"" to use Playskool's advertising of this series of toys in the early 70s that included Texaco, Holiday Inn, and McDonald's. Of the three, the McDonald's set was the only one worth having, and it was one of the most memorable toys of the 70s. Not only was it a place I was intimately familiar with as a kid (our family ate there more than a few times a week ? and it was a sit down meal with all 8 of us), but the fact was remarkably re-enforced by the design of the toy. The restrooms were uncannily like the one's at our local McDonald's, and the whole thing just seemed so intimately familiar that I could play out our family adventures from that very evening with a few block-headed figures.  Although, in truth, the genius of this toy was the dinging cash register and the elaborate tray system. Not only did the trays fit between a character's chin and chest so they could carry them around. But there was a kind of tray sliding system that allowed you to move them throughout the kitchen area, and even place used trays into a depository in the side of the restaurant. It was one of the most compelling designs of a toy that I can recall from my childhood, and the ""familiar places"" theme that Playskool used was both insidious and fascinating all at once. I loved this toy, and the triangle hat- wearing blockhead characters always struck me as unique, but the larger fact is that the whole toy was actually as functional and efficient as McDonald's ? which is why I still love them both.  And if you'll excuse me, I have to go and bid on this set over at Ebay, which, by the way, offers some wonderful images with brilliant detail of the very elements that intrigued me so as a kid.  The restrooms were true-to-life!  The cash register that dings and the trays, which were my favorite part of this set,  they fit cleanly between the blockhead characters' chin and chest  A drive-thru McDonald's in a 1974 play set  The Tray Return was my favorite part of the set, it was so streamlined, just like McDonald's  "Jim Groom,The Future of WPMu,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-future-of-wpmu/,10/10/2009,"There has been a lot of discussion about the future of WPMu with the coming merge of WPMu and WP, and I understand there are concerns and issues all around. I'm not in the business of selling WPMu, so my concerns aren't so much caught up with the preservation of the WPMu name, but they are very much centered around the future of the multi-blogging functionality. In many ways the coming merge provides us with an opportunity to re-think some things about the WPMu architecture and the possibilities of what it might mean for individuals to manage their own WPMu sites.  I think the most exciting prospect of the merge is that WPMu will finally become as simple to install and maintain as a regular old WordPress install. And if that's the case and the raison d'etre of the merge, then the whole push for a multi-user blogging system is not nearly as essential as a way to aggregate, visualize, and expose the work happening around a particular community within any given blog. If I were thinking the merger through I would be just as interested in the possibilities of robust and distributed syndication built into future core of WP ?  something that at least for me seems so much more important than giving everyone a blog on your blogging system. I don't necessarily want people on our blogging system as much as I want them to easily set up their own site with RSS (and a WP site with the added bonus of many blogs in one install wouldn't suck) . Why not start thinking about how to integrate plugins like FeedWordPress, Sitewide Tags Pages, BDP RSS (which it turns out still does work with WPMu 2.8x, despite my earlier post), etc. into the core and truly supporting the idea of a blog as an aggregation point for a wide range of sites. WordPress has pretty much perfected the ease of use for publishing, and that is why they rule, but working a more robust framework within the future releases for re-publishing and real-time web stuff would certainly be powerful in my mind, but this is quite selfish because it is what I'm really interested in beyond WP or WPMu. I want an elegant, feed-driven aggregation system that brings the work of an entire community into conversation with itself.  And what really gets me about this is that we are pretty close right now with UMW Blogs, I grab feeds from external blogs all the time that are related to UMW an pull them into our sitewide ""tags"" blog (the name tags here is confusing, it is simply a republishing of everything in the entire WPMu install) with FeedWordPress. For example, I stumbled across this post in the tags blog on UMW Blogs tonight, which was actually being pulled in from a WordPress.com blog of a student who graduated years ago, but regularly blogs about her work in historic preservation. This particular post was all about a book she read as an undergraduate in Historic Preservation, and how great a resource it is. A valuable post, especially since the professor who recommended that book, W. Brown Morton, retired last year. There is a kind of eternal echo in a system like this that students, faculty, and staff can continue to feed into a community of teaching and learning well beyond their matriculation period, or even their career.  I often think why we couldn't just use UMW Blogs for aggregating clubs and organization news, course blogs, etc., but have everyone's actual blog in their own space. Now, don't get me wrong, I still see the value of something like WPMu for a simple solution for a quick blog without the updating and versioning headache, but I also see what we are doing as instructional technologists, scholars and students in higher ed right now is much bigger than a particular blogging system or software, I see my job as working with people to imagine the implications and possibilities of managing and maintaining their digital identity in a moment when we are truly in a deep transformation of information, identity, and scholarship. It's key to keep this in mind well beyond the application, and when I think about WP or WPMu, I love it because the architecture has enabled me to grasp this more clearly than any other thing in my online experience. So how might working with people to wrap their heads around this space, and manage their own WP install (or whatever floats their boat) on their own space (the Gardner Campbell SysAdmin vision is very much at work here ? see his ""bags of gold"" talk for a mind blowing discussion of this very thing) as a means to make that lesson of the digital archaeology of knowledge that much more apparent and powerful.  To this end, I have been experimenting with what the new merged WP might be like. For example, we have a few professors with mapped domains on UMW Blogs which basically host their personal/professional site, Jeff McClurken's mcclurken.org is a good example of this, as is Steve Greenlaw's hosting of his personal blog Pedablogy on UMW Blogs. So, with both of these domains I have created the logic of what a merged WordPress might look like for each of these professors. Steve Grenlaw would have his own domain stevegreenlaw.org on which he could create all his course blogs (as many as he wanted off of one domain and one WP install) and with built in aggregation, he could make it easy enough for students to get their own space wherever and share their feeds to create syndicated spaces for his course discussions, postings, etc. And, by extension, we could pull anything off of stevegreenlaw.org because as I see it he would share his course feeds with us. In fact, this is precisely what Zach Whalen is already doing with his own course sites that he hosts and designed himself with his Drupal kungfu, and it works beautifully.  But, here is the kicker, for anyone who can't do what Zach does, we'll host domains that professors purchase and, ideally, map all their domains onto one WP install that can manage many multi-blogging solutions from one install. The whole Russian Doll thing that WPMu can do with the Multi-Site Manager plugin. So you offer a Bluehost like setup for faculty, and if that is too much, allow them to map a domain, take control of their own course work, and encourage an aggregated course management model that pushes students to take control of their digital identity and spaces by extension. Giving students a space and voice on your domain or application is not the same as asking them to create, manage and maintain their own space. Moreover, it doesn't feed into the idea of a digital trajectory that starts well before they come to college and will end well after they leave. This model extends the community, and brings in key resources like a recent graduate discussing an out-of-print historic preservation text book a retired professor assigned to be one of the best resources for an aspiring Preservation graduate student. This is what it is all about, right there, and it's not gonna happen in silos and on someone else's space, we need to provision, empower, and imagine the merge as a full powered move to many. many domains of one's own.  "Jim Groom,Digital Storytelling: the Course,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-storytelling-the-course/,1/19/2010,"OK, so I've been on paternity leave enjoying some quiet time with my ever growing family, and as a result the bava as well as my general annoying presence online has been limited as a result. But, despite that, I've been developing (while at the same time teaching) a course titled Digital Storytelling for the Computer Science department here at UMW, and we are now in our second week. I'm pretty excited about this course because I'm actually shaping it as an experiment that focuses upon cultivating one's online presence, or digital identity if you will, as a mode and means of storytelling.  So, rather than focusing specifically on the art of storytelling with digital media from the outset, I've started off with a slightly different approach that each student should start of with a space of their own to manage and consider the implications of becoming the owner of their own story. Of take some responsibility and possession of the work they will do for the next 15 weeks, and to this end each student has signed-up for their own web hosting service and domain as a means to create their own storytelling/experimental platform. A domain of their own, or to quote Gardner Campbell's essay on the topic, ""A Personal Cyber Infrastructure."" No that can not be all for a digital storytelling class, but from the outset it actually frames their work in getting familiar with a digital environment like a LAMP server and various open source applications as a means to understand through experimentation and tinkering how the process of publishing as well as the to manage their online lives for themselves is very much within their control.  I really don't know if this is the right approach, and I'm actually basing this experiment as much on our work at UMW's DTLT as on my own development with open source applications and web hosting back in 2004/2005 ? thanks to Zach Davis and his very innovative Hosting Co-Operative ? in which I got a LAMP account with CPanel for 3 bucks a month and was able to experiment with basic code, open source apps as well as get my head around DNS settings, FTPing files, server management, and everything else that comes with managing one's own little piece of the web. There is no question in my mind that Zach's work with Hosting Cooperative (as well as his introducing me to WordPress as well as tutoring me on what XML, PHP, and Apache actually meant) got me my job at UMW, and I'm wondering if learning some of this stuff with a simultaneously technical, practical, and conceptual approach might help everyone in the class get a sense of the power and possibility that lays at the heart of a domain of one's own. So not only is it an experiment, but it's one that extrapolates its value from my own experience which may make it doubly flawed and problematic, nonetheless I think it may have some value in the end. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to read posts like this that suggests learning a bit of code and how the web works both generally and specifically may not only be useful, but increasingly essential to a sense of cultural and personal literacy as we move forward (via Joss Winn).  I have much more to say about the idea behind the class, but this will come out over time given that my process throughout the class will be a focus on narrating what we are doing, how and why I'm approaching certain topics in certain ways, as well as sharing the resources we create as both individuals and a class. In many ways my own digital story got started around the process of figuring how to actually manage my online hosting space, as well as hacking and experimenting with open source applications like WordPress. My narrative is very much one of becoming in relationship to a series of applications and processes I had to learn in relation to and with others, and I really hope this class follow a similar pattern for everyone involved. And that is not to say the process has to be one of technical detail and explanation, but rather a way for everyone to capture their thinking and reflection as they approach a series of topics, issues, and challenges ? all of which has the added benefit of a pre-fabricated community of classmates to provide feedback, support, and share their own successes and failures ? not to mention the world wide web which looms larger in this class than probably any of us really understand just yet. That's what my education online has looked like, and I wonder if we can capture some small part of the power of such a process over the next 15 weeks. I'm not sure, but one can dream.  "Jim Groom,Digital Storytelling: Week 2,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-storytelling-week-2/,2/6/2010,"Week two was dedicated to exploring and experimenting with the ""Domain of One's Own"" Gardner Campbell had conceptually framed in week 1. They all bought a domain, and what I found interesting is a number of students bought .info domains because they were cheap (.89 cents), I kinda like that. A domain is a domain is a domain ? a url to call home, and if it costs next to nothing all the better, and you never know they could be the start of a new trend in domain names. They also had to setup their web hosting account, and while I didn't limit who they could host with, I wanted to provide a cheap, short-term option for hosting that I could potentially help with in the event of a meltdown.  So, I asked Zach Davis and Lucas Thurston of Cast Iron Coding fame if they would revive the idea behind the hosting-cooperative and get students setup on a standard, shared LAMP web server with CPanel on a monthly basis. Zach and Lucas came through for me, as they always do, and provided a short-term solution that wouldn't cost students $100 or $130 up front for a year. Rather, 10 bucks a month for 3 or 4 months which is a bit more expensive that Bluehost, but it's short term and if they go with this option (which most, but not all, did) they can decide what they want to do with their data at the end of class ? it will actually be an issue we'll spend the last week dealing with both technically and conceptually. I figure they have an array of options to consider: moving to a commodity web host full-time, take down their work all together, move it to UMW Blogs, WordPress.com, Blogger, Drupal, whatever ? they need to think this through and make a decision, and it will be an excellent way to round out the course.  Week 2 was kinda fun for me, we talked through pointing their domains to the web hosting nameservers, creating subdomains, looking at the file manager in CPanel, what addon domains are, where their databases are, as well as PHPMyAdmin, but most importantly I showed them Fantastico. This made them getting up and going with their own WordPress blog rather easy (and we did go with WordPress at my suggestion for now, but already a few have installed and are playing with Drupal, Geeklog, etc.). I think I want them to have to install a CMS or forum software from scratch, and I might ask them to experiment with this over the next ten weeks?we'll see. Cause while I like Fantastico well enough, it isn;t great for installing more complex applications like Drupal and Typo3, and I think the experience of installign a web app manually has some value in terms of learning how the pieces work.  I think I enjoyed these two classes so much because I personlly learned so much by playing with the CPanel and figuring out how to manage my own blog/data, and while I can;t guarantee that was the experience for them. It was apparent that many were having fun, and while it is at times confusing and frustrating, there is a sense of pride that goes with rolling your own that quickly becomes apparent. I have to find a way to bring in at least one new element/trick/tip for CPanel and their web hosting every week, to get the full effect of what it is they have control over ? any ideas would be more than welcome?  What was also nice about week two is that a few students came out of the blog gate running. Matthew Keaton created a tutorial for the class about installing and tweaking themes for WordPress (a form of digital storytelling near and dear to my heart). And Mr. Charlie Rocket took the time to photoshop a compelling image of his online haunts, inspired by Gardner's discussion of the nonlinearity of cyber presence. I love the way he uses the cityscape to suggests varying levels (or heights?) of presence through a particular tool.

Jesse Fillerup's Fredericskburg's Musician Marketplace    This course blog for the History of American Music experiments on several levels, and I think it hearkens back to an off-handed comment Brian Lamb made a few years ago: ""What we need is a Craig's List for education."" This isn't that, but Jesse Fillerup's vision for designing a space where each student creates a historical persona and then uses the course site as a means to exchange wares and services, as well as seek them out, provided an opportunity to explore the idea. Each of the classified ads comes from a specific historical period, and each student was tasked with posting to the central site either a job they have available, or a job they're looking for. These requests were to include a link back to a profile of the historical persona they created on anything from MySpace to Twitter to Facebook to a blog. It was a brilliant idea, and from the student reflections I think it was received with some enthusiasm.  Here's a good example of a profile created for a historical persona through Facebook (also, here is the original ad on the course site) and another historical organization created with a blog.  Zach Whalen's Writing through Media   From the course objectives:  > The key, two-fold premise of this seminar: that new media technologies offer new literacies and that these literacies depend to some extent on using media technology to communicate effectively. In this advanced writing course, the successful student will balance theory with practice, and the successful student will leave with technical, working knowledge of some New Media technology and a deeper fluency in media culture. She will also be familiar with what it means to think critically with and through these technologies. The final output of the seminar will be a portfolio-style website ? built on the UMWBlogs platform ? around which students will build their digital identities.  And this is exactly what this course does, frames writing through media as a space in which students imagine, build, and design their own online presence. At the heart of this course is the building of one's digital identity, and the results have been pretty amazing. Take a look at Kay Bechtold's and Rachael Wonderlin's portfolio sites for two excellent examples of what students are building through this course ? a quick look illustrates they are mapping their domains on UMW Blogs and redesigning their space through CSS and more custom code ? a domain of one's own come to fruition at UMW ?? What's more, students are not only cultivating their own spaces, but also blogging about this experience on the course blog, and also maintaining a twitter stream. The way Zach designed the course blog in Drupal to catch all three of these different streams of writing on the frontpage is an absolutely brilliant design, and one I will be stealing for my course next semester.  Sue Fernsebner's Gender in Chinese History   Not only does Sue Fernsebner use a blog as a quick and easy way to disseminate announcements, post the syllabus, provide access to readings, and point to useful resources, she also created a second online discussion space for experimenting with using a re-themed blog as a discussion space premised more on the design and logic of Twitter. I love this kind of experimentation (which I believe is germane to the space given its relative ease and flexibility), and her use of the P2 theme for WordPress illustrates how this kind of thing can be quite simple to implement. Not only does this format make posting rather simple for students, it also provides feeds for each discussion topic (via tags), and organizes conversations along the lines of the chronology of the course ? which allows you to always foreground the most recent discussions.  I'd love to hear more about how this approach worked for discussion in this course ? because it appears from the site it was rather lively. Fact is, I always want to hear the details from those constantly experimenting, because such an example of deeply thoughtful approach to the intersection of teaching practice and digital space is exactly what we should be promoting. What works and what doesn't? More than that?why?  Allyson Poska's History of Latin America II   In this upper-level course on Latin American History, the course blog became the center of student research for their research papers. Over the course of the semester, the blog was used to develop a particular topic in the field, fill out their bibliography, and make connections among different ideas and types of materials. To get the process started at the beginning of the semester, each student read at least one article about Latin America or Latino culture in the US in a major US newspaper, either in print or on-line. Once blogging US news about various countries in latin America was underway, they then switched the focus to specific stories/journal articles dealing with their particular research topic. You can see the guidelines laid out for the students here, which are quite thorough.  It is also interesting, and quite useful, how the posts where broken down into categories on a country-by-country basis, filtering posts by nation might prove both helpful and useful. Not surprisingly, Venezuela (the Chavez factor?) and Haitii (the disastrous earthquake) were the most popular topics, and the posts cover a wide range of issues from over 16 Latin American countries. What is useful about this example is that the blog assignment is so clearly structured that it may prove useful when working with faculty who favor a more structured approach to introducing blogging into the classroom.  Joseph DiBella's Arts 492: Individual Study   From the course description:  > ARTS 492 Individual Study is an advanced course for studio art majors who are prepared both with technical experience and conceptual basis to pursue focused work that is based upon a proposal that the artist generates and develops during the semester. Although the emphasis is on individual problem solving, the group as a whole will hold critiques (online and in person) that will review the progress of their work and discuss reading assignments.  And given the limitations of transporting the works-in-progress back and forth for critique, the class depended heavily on this online course discussion space for posting images of their works-in-progress and sharing the conceptualization and presentation of their art. There are some excellent examples of this here, here, here, and here.  "Jim Groom,Summer of Love: Domain Mapping,http://bavatuesdays.com/summer-of-love-domain-mapping/,7/14/2010,"Image credit: This cheesy t-shirt over at neatoshop that I love.  My love affair with domain mapping has been well documented on this blog, and last week, before I went on vacation, UMW quietly took a big leap forward in terms of experimenting with domain mapping as a way to bring some of the more official sites being built on UMW Blogs back into the umw.edu domain. Fact is, we have successfully mapped a site on UMW Blogs for the University Faculty Council on this domain: http://ufc.umw.edu (running all the while on http://umwblogs.org).  It was pretty cool to see how easy and pleasant the whole process was (Deb Hovey in Network Services made it a cinch, and the future of IT at UMW is looking bright for all of us these days ?? ), and this marks a really important moment for the larger community on all levels seeing WordPress as a solution for communicating and making distributed publishing to the web easier. Our University Relations folks are framing an information site/newsletter running through UMW Blogs, but also pointed to a umw.edu namespace ? which will provide official information for the community, and allow more direct conversation across the environment (more on this as it unfolds). Fact is, UMW is poised right now to make a complete transition from our current website structure (a homemade php template driven CMS on top of Adobe Contribute) to a full blown campus wide adoption of WordPress 3.0 Multisite. Looks like I may be working on the consulting with this, and I am now a proud member of the forming web committee. What's more, there should be a forthcoming advertisement for a hardcore WordPress developer at UMW to be posted on the bava in the near future ?? That's right, UMW is ready to become a WordPress shop for its primary web publishing tool ? if all the stars align ? and I am just beginning to get excited thinking about the possibilities.  Like why can't we make UMW's History and American Studies department site, or the Economics department site, stock for departments. Then start thinking about ways to feed in course content, or aggregate activity through syndication around departments and disciplines ? a space where the work on UMW Blogs can be easily featured on umw.edu. And then there are faculty personal sites. Hey, our Novell storage and network space ?  with the relatively unused www files for hand coded HTML ? is going away this November. Why can't we re- open the discussion of faculty members controlling their own site, and even getting a umw.edu domain to boot if they like, though they could always map their own like Warren Rochelle, to name just one of more than 70 mapped domains on UMW Blogs.  Fact is, this idea is still percolating around campus, and between Zach Whalen's domain mapping work with his Writing through Media Class, various faculty members simply grabbing their own, and a Digital Storytelling class very much rooted in the idea of one's domain as a sense of ownership and charge of one's intellectual presence and online data ? a course undergirded by Gardner Campbell's Personal Cyberinfrastructure epiphany ? I would think the conversation and possibilities are just starting to emerge.  And UMW student's are increasingly realizing the value of creating a domain for framing their experitise. Check out this site created by a UWM student for no class on the fly: hirehassan.com  ? not a bad way to show off your portfolio work. And to see a beautiful instance of this with student work, check out Rachael Dawn's Portfolio here, very impressive (and part of Zach Whalen's aforementioned Writing through Media course).  The domain of one's own is always fresh to me, and when I see factuly like Jessie Fillerup grabbing and mapping her own domain to blog about Tennis, or Gregg Stull creating his own blog and domain though his own bluehost server, I know it's a concept we can still go a long way towards cultivating and nurturing a sense of the possibilities throughout the year. And while the actual mapping is not always essential to frame one's presence, the commitment and notion of conceptual ownership of one's data and digital identity begins to really matter. And that conceptual shift, whether one chooses it over the long haul or not, is important to a sense of thinking about the deeper questions of digital identity, literacy, and the critical creation of one's self.  And what's more, the underlying technology and architecture fueling such a web publishing platform need not be limited to WordPress, it can act as our hub, but it allows us to rethink our use of MediaWiki ? which currently runs our documentation, courses lists, and various pages for course sites. How does a well-gardened wiki ? as Brian lamb points out here ? -help us move both within and beyond the personal to the collaborative with open technologies? Well, if we look to the outstanding work the UBC team has done to document their process with creating a Resource Management Framework on an enterprise scale, as well as the work the CUNY Academic Commons has done integrating MediaWiki seamlessly into the WPMu/BuddyPress flow, we get the roadmap to a real powerful content creation frameowrk that is open and flexible. And just yesterday, Joss Winn articulated the benefits of such a system quite brilliantly in this video on WordPress Beyond Blogging (Winn FTW!):  WordPress beyond blogging from UKOLN on Vimeo.  So, seems to me like certain things in the web publishing domain with open source tools are still around, in fact, they are leading some of the most innovative examples of integrating the idea of fluid publishing, identity, and networked learning into the academy on institutional scales. And while the EDUPUNKS are constantly being counted out, or co-opted as the poster children for the decline of education, and by default Western Civilization  ? I think we still have a few more concrete examples of why all the hoopla around vertically integrated LMS, standards integration, et cetera, still doesn't get to the heart of the matter ? you can't innovate in a prison house, no matter how vertically integrated it is (just a more tightly run and designed penitentiary). I mean we can look to other companies within the LMS space, or write love letters to Google, but whether or not the free and open web has been bought and sold already, and we re just a burnt out hippie threat, I can't help but think reporting the meainstream vision of edtech and the web will ever get us anywhere. We need to promote and support what is happening now that is good. And I have yet to find an example in BlackBoard ? got any I can see?  Point is, the open web is not a convenience we need to evolve, it is a public good we need to preserve and foster. You cannot do that when it's all been accounted for and the gig is up ? if ""open and free is an ideology"" then isn't ""closed and expensive"" just as ideological as well ? and shouldn't the two be in deep struggle on a larger stage? Rather, what's happening, is the one is trying to subsume the other under cloud of night and terminological uncertainty. The LIS standard that's been announced makes systemwide integration easier perhaps, but does it give people control over their identities and data? Does it promote a sense of one's space and value on the web in real time? Does it deliver on the idea of a Personal Learning Network on the open web undergirded by syndication and community? These things are integral to teaching and learning on the web right now, and they have little, if anything, to do with an LMS, or so it seems to me.  And that is why I love domain mapping so much ? it makes all this so perfectly clear to me.  Updated:  All this said, I forgot to mention one of the projects involving an LMS I am actually excited about, the open LMS being openly developed by Stas Su?cov. Given the trajectory UMW is on right now, we can start experimenting with Stas's work as soon as this Fall, and start thinking how our setup will take care of all the bloated overhead and insane costs that the dreary LMS provides us at such an insane price. I'm ready to push for a replacement, and if I have to go edtech guerilla, as Matt Gold lays the framework, I will. Remember, that $116 million dollarsduring these times of austerity came from all the blood that's been sucked out of institutional coffers through such a deal with the devil. Oepn is not over, it's just been forgotten because there is so much other cool stuff to report on in edtech, like how the iPad has made everything else irrelevant, and at the same time costlier ??  "Jim Groom,DS106: An Internet Odyssey,http://bavatuesdays.com/ds106-an-internet-odyssey/,9/18/2010,"I'm teaching Digital Storytelling for the second time this semester, and we just finished week 4. The semester goes quick, and last time I didn't blog this course nearly as much as I'd hoped to. So this semester I am trying to build the very assignments for the class into my blogging routine. A means to directly integrate the work I do here with the work I do in class, which makes total sense to me given the entire course is framed around the idea of one's own space and the framing of a digital identity, both of which are part and parcel of an ongoing, fragmented narrative. It would be silly to try and divorce my work on the bava from the course. In fact, my work on the bava over the years is probably why I'm teaching a computer science course in the first place. My expertise is not in programming, and as an introductory, 100-level course this is very much about the web, and identity on the web as a form of narrative. The class is rooted in the web as a means of story telling, and like the web remains dependent upon everybody's willingness to experiment, make mistakes, and participate regularly by bringing a sense of wonder and their own interests and visions to the fore on a regular basis and with their own voice.  I'm lucky in many regards because I can teach this course both like a lecture and a studio workshop. It can vary its approach on a regular basis depending on the topic, but at the same time it depends to some great degree upon the extended conversations between and amongst the students that happens on the web, not in class. The second time around this course is proving to be a lot of fun. We have worked through both O'Reilly's ""What is Web 2.0?"" essay as well as the recent ""Web is Dead"" essay in Wired. Everyone has gotten their own domain and set up their own hosting, and folks are continuing to play with themes and plugins throughout the early weeks. And a major shout out to Media Megan who is blogging her work with CPanel and WordPress, providing a tutorial for redirecting the main domain (something everyone will be doing shortly, she just figured it out early), as well as how she got lightbox working on her blog. Those are some serious tutorials right there, and work like this that shares what one is learning, and in the process helps others who are trying to do similar things may be some of the greatest products of this course, and I have so very little to do with them. All I did is push them on a platform of their own, the care and more detailed attention to the contours of that platform is a natural by-product of heading down that road. No one asked Megan to blog everything she did on her blog in this way, it emerged as a process for her, and turns out she is extremely good at it.  This past week we have moved into the realm of visual storytelling, and on Tuesday the ds106 internauts got their first taste of rapid prototyping a story in small groups. Basically at the beginning of class I give them a particular set of parameters, and within a half hour 9 groups of three students each are to come up with a narrative give the restrictions. This is a lot of fun, and it's kind of like teaching a segment of the class with the demo first. They immediately try making a narrative just based on what they know, and then we go through them, and keep building on that experience for the following two weeks. Anyway, the rapid prototype this week was using Flickr's ""A Story in Five Frames"", they have to break up into groups and basically come up with a story in half hour. It's some of the best moments in the whole semester when they are lively imagining and framing their narrative, then scouring the web to visualize and communicate it. This semester's narrative were remarkably good, you can see them all here. I got a real kick out of ""Shark attack?"" (sharks and zombies proving to be a major motif of this class thus far):  > Shark Week  >  > A lovely day at the beach, my girlfriends and I decided to take a dip in the water. All of a sudden, we heard a commotion on the sand. I thought people were checking us out, but they looked frantic. We turned and saw a dark shadow in the waves and realized it was a shark! We ran for our lives and found the relief of the hot sand. We looked back and discovered a fat man in a shark suit trying to scare the beach goers.  >  > A quick narrative by Karen Strat , Mina Recta , and Carlie Hampton  After that, I asked them to apply the same logic to an established narrative. For example, try and communicate the story of your favorite film (or any film for that matter) in six frames. Once again this was a really fun exercise to both do (I have been doing all my own exercises right alongside them), as well as to talk with them about in class. We spent almost the entire class dissecting screen shots from films they liked, and asking them to really think about elements of composition. And what's great, is it is all from their examples. I mean, look how much you can do with a few frames from The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) (thanks and credit to Garrett Bush):  I mean Wes Anderson is as much a painter as he is a filmmaker, and through this shot selection and a quick examination in class we can actually start to breakdown how many of the narratives they love are firmly rooted in visual storytelling, more than that, a particular means of framing that story is what gives that film, show, director, etc. an identity. A sense of style, a vision for communicating in a particular way. Which to me is the whole idea of this class, and it is never to early to start framing your own vision. So right now they are all doing the Daily Shoot assignments for the next week (ds306 through ds313). And I have to say, just about everyone is not only having fun with these daily assignments thus far (the course blog is just filled with brilliant and creative proof), but this series of assignments also gives them an immediate community of others to join in and share with around the web. And I have to thank Alan Levine for turning me on to Daily Shoot (Alan is the web!), because this assignment has me more excited about teaching that I think I've ever been before. As a result of this week-long experiment they have to get a Flickr account, get a twitter account, and blog their images. But that is just the technical mechanics, where it gets interesting is in addition to this they have to think about composing and sharing an image based on a general guideline everyone gets each day. A prompt hundreds of other people are also doing that aren't a part of the class. Which means the ds106 internauts will see and learn from their work, and ? and here's the kicker?vice versa. Hundreds of people will look at and learn from the work coming from this course. What an awesome setup for a class like this.  What's more, the course blog is really coming together nicely. And the real difference is a streamlined approach to categorizing assignments, projects, etc. that has everything to do with custom menus. What's nice is their work all feeds into the course blog using the FeedWordpress plugin. And what FeedWordPress can do is convert tags into categories. So I give them a specific tag for each assignment which then shows up as a drop down menu of assignments in the menu navigation of the header. We can also feature the rapid prototype projects like the Image Stories when it is tagged as a story, and breakdown the dailyshoot posts on a day-by-day basis. So, when they tag the posts on their own blog I can organize all their work coming into the course blog through those tags-cum- category. And given custom menus allows you to create page tabs for categories, not to mention slick drop-down menus, I have all the assignments categorized by assignment number, and can even break out separately the Daily Shoot posts. What's more, I am using the UMW Wiki as a kind of directory where they put in all their own info, like their domain name, blog url, Twitter handle, Flickr address, YouTube account, etc. And as you can see from the directory page in the DS106 course blog, that wiki page is being pulled right back into a course blog page ? the blog wiki hybrid (the bionic bliki) has been here for years, I just never realized it.  Just like last year, they all add their own domain to the field provided in the sidebar on the course blog (the Add Link plugin), I make sure their feeds are working and then they're off and running ? and the organization is much needed because last semester 29 students had well over 1000 posts. And this semester 27 students are already up to 250 posts, which is a very healthy pace given we didn't really start blogging until week 3. So, it's clear I need to get a hold of the streams of different assignments, projects, narratives, etc. Custom menus let's WordPress function a little more like a content management system than it ever has before, and for that I am grateful. What's more, with these menus, I no longer have to hack my themes, which means anyone can do this stuff. it has further lowered the threshold for publishing attractive and dynamic content on the web with WordPress.  So, in short, things are good on the Digital Storytelling class front, and I have to get back in picture taking mode, because like with much of what I'll be doing in several projects, everything that happens is in direct response and in participation with the process of creating, framing, and maintaining an ongoing narrative of one's self, work, and ideas ? I mean that's what I do. That's blogging and Flickr and Twitter and YouTube and whatever else. But this class is awesome because it allows me to step back from those things for a second and think about what it all really is, it's a new and very powerful mode of telling our stories. Of narrating a sense of who and what we are digitally, the ""I"" that was always assumed in argument papers for your English literature course has come out of hiding. It's found a new home on the web.  I mean what do you do in a class where images like this are the fruits of a mixed up assignment?  Image credit: ""Homeward bound"" by les.epinards  And the title of this image says it all for me, this class is bringing me back home to the wonder of the web, which is something I have desperately needed.  "Jim Groom,"DS106 week 1: Introductions, webhosts, and a domain of your own",http://bavatuesdays.com/ds106-week-1-introductions-webhosts-and-domain-of-your-own/,1/12/2011,"Welcome to ds106, watching the eight minute video for my a rather unofficial introduction:  ds106: Week 1 Intro from Jim Groom on Vimeo.  ### Assignments for Week 1:  A Quick introduction   By way of introduction tell us all a story about something that happened to you recently. It can be video, audio images, good old text, or any other tool you like. If you like restrictions, try and tell it quick (no more than 30 seconds in terms of audio or video ? -extrapolate out from there for the other media).     A Domain of One's Own: Webhost and Domain  Week 1 will be dedicated to have those interested in getting up and running with their own domain and webhost setup. If you have had the itch to take this plunge, now is a good time to try it out cause there are a lot of people involved in this course who could help you along. What's more, we could all benefit from hearing about your experience. You can view the assignment and respective tutorials I have provided at the following link: http://ds106.us/2011/01/12/domain-and-webhosting/ I encourage you to add more resources for this process to the comments of that post, or in the course wiki, the more documentation, the better.  I particularly hope Brian Lamb and Martin Weller will get off their asses and set up their own webhost account and manage their own blogs (that goes for you too Blackall!). As D'Arcy Norman would say they're ""corporate sharecroppers,"" unless of course their blogs were hosted by the Apple App store ? in that case they would be freedom fighters (nothing like starting off this class with a smackdown for my friends ?? ).  Gearing up for week 2   Already folks have started reading, watching and responding to Gardner Campbellïs ""Personal Cyberinfrastructure"" essay as well as the companion video ""No Digital Facelifts"" (you can find them both here). This will be the focus of the course leading into week two, which will culminate with Gardner Campbell live video streaming for everyone to enjoy on Thursday, January 20th at 6:00 PM (EST) ? and yes we will be archiving and sharing this talk after the fact.  And if you want to see what folks have already done with Gardner's seminal discussion of carving out a domain of one's own and its implications for teaching and learning, check out Tom Woodward's Remix of the talk, along with Grant Potter's remix of Tom's remix Not to mention Lisa Lane's discussion of Gardner's ideas here, which I'll take a small quote from below:  > The practices of narrating, curating, and sharing could put the control back in faculty hands. It's true that it needs to be in student hands, of course, but for faculty to serve as a model (as Gardner writes in his article) they must somehow free themselves from the autocracy that has emerged along with the technologies.  And all this before we are even out the gate!!!!  So, like my partner in crime has noted so eloquently here, it is time to push yourself beyond your creative comfort zone, time for us to wrestle honestly with the future of education through praxis and engagement and, more than anything else in my book, it's time to make some damned art already. Let's go!!!!  "Jim Groom,The ds106 99: #3 Innovation in elearning interview,http://bavatuesdays.com/innovation-in-elearning-interview/,4/13/2011,"Sharon Gardner, a student at the Open University in the UK, is currently undertaking a Masters in Online and Distance Education. She has been tasked with interviewing an innovator in education as part of the H807 Innovations in elearning module. She sent me this email, and given I am just one of the many innovators in ds106, I figured I would reproduce the interview, and her questions below (in bold) with my own answers, and then encourage others involved in ds106 to share their thoughts, ideas, and opinions so Sharon can get a much better idea of what ds106 is all about (here is the Google document with the questions sans my answers). Keep in mind all questions may not be relevant to you so just answer the questions you want to, if you want to.  What's more, this document reminds me of the idea Scottlo had the other night, namely that we should start putting together a short documentary film about the ds106 experience (kinda like Alan's ""Amazing Stories of Openness""). I absolutely love this idea and want to follow up on it very, very soon ? it could be fodder for the ds106 99 postathon.  If you are interested take the jumpƒ.  The aim of this interview is to examine innovation in elearning as exemplified in the  use of internet technology to provide an open online course radio station. Digital  storytelling (ds106) is a formal, credit-bearing course offered to computing science  students at the University of Mary Washington. It's also a MOOC, a massive open  online course, whereby participation is open to anyone on a distance-basis without  formal accreditation. Much of the course activity takes place online, with each student  setting up their own online space and using various digital media to create and  publish content. [Your name here] is theƒ  ƒactually, how would you describe yourself?  Professionally, I am an instructional technology specialist at the University of Mary Washington. I also teach as an adjunct professor at UMW. My job entails working with students and faculty integrating web-based technologies into the fabric of teaching and learning. More generally, I'm pretty annoying to be around because I tend to push on an idea until it breaks. I'm an obsessive, manic personality who is lucky enough to have an awesome family, the world's most kickass blog, and a job I love.  What are your personal views on innovation in education, what uses of technology do you find innovative and why?  This is a big question, and one that fits my big personality perfectly ?? Personally, I think innovation in technology is that space wherein what we thought impossible is made not only possible, but transparent. For me, this is not a sudden discovery, but a constant, collaborative effort to re-imagine the possible. And what is amazing in this moment is this can happen across innumerable domains of one's life with the social web ? and for me that is the coolest and most exciting innovation happening right now ? though I think it is more likened to a major cultural shift. Our ideas about education, play, relationships, etc. are collapsing ? these domains are blurring ? making the possibilities for meaningful, distributed learning possible through real, powerful relationships that are enabled by technology, but not premised on them.  The uses I find most innovative with the actual tools are those uses that re- infuse the technical with the personal, in other words, provide the space for two or more individuals to relate and communicate in new ways ? the blogosphere has done this in innumerable brilliant ways for a decade now, YouTube for more than 5 years (though it has also become a copyright constable more and more), Twitter for the last 3 years, etc. The greatest innovations we are seeing when it comes to technology have not been in the educational sphere ? though they may be indirectly related ? they are happening on the world wide open internet ? and that is where education needs to be if it is serious about innovation. The reason being is all the major innovation in the social web alluded to above come with their own grammar, syntax, and cultural conventions of interaction ? -they are the emergent culture of community and communication that characterizes out moment ? and they are just a few of the many.  The innovation lies within the latent vernacular of any cultural movement, the trick is not turning that vernacular into a rude vehicle for commercialization and profit ? which is very, very hard indeed. In fact, it may frame the dark side of all this rah rah talk about innovation that many, including myself, get caught up in ? innovation is often designed very much with a market in mind and its ability to open and truly transform something as fundamental and seemingly self evident as sharing the world's knowledge is often forced to face the market realities of the world system that we have created which is very much dependent on Capitalism. A truly innovative technology like the web should be able to challenge the hegemony of the market system, and the way so many of the most important innovations ultimately conform to this logic might be a cause for alarm.  How would you characterise success in elearning innovation?  For me what characterizes a good online (or elearning) course, which I think equally applies to a good face-to-face course, is the ability for the course dynamic to come alive. The ability for there to be a shared sense of purpose, excitement, discussion, and play. That last element can't be emphasized enough ? the idea of making a subject interesting, fun, and accessible through good analogies to life and popular culture is not valued nearly enough. In that regard, the challenge for good online courses has not necessarily been the ability to deliver the content ? it has been a crisis of being able to manifest personality, interaction, and the spaces in between. The complexities of a group dynamic that is so crucial to how we have conceptualized the class (which is itself being re-thought currently) ? the nuances, the inflections, the way we look, our accents, our hair color, our interests, our influences, our general beings ? all this and more matters dearly.  I believe the social web allows us to infuse this more and more into online learning ? to replace the idea of content and modules with the people behind their ideas. The ability to infuse a course that is entirely online with a sense of purpose through the people that constitute the experience is success ? and for far too long we have accepted much less and called it online learning ? and some of that was technical, but now there is really no excuse. What's more, universities should be on the forefront of making this happen in online learning, but I am not so sure they are. You may be at one of the few universities (Open University), and I am not so sure how successful OpenLearn has been, whether it has been too deeply tied to the idea of OERs, which for me is about content not interaction around that content ? it is still a laudable pursuit but it is the relations around the content you really want to capture and magnify, but too often we are more concerned with the content for its own sake ? -and that seems to be what elearning has already always done, maybe just not as openly ? I still don't think it solves the interaction issue.  How do you get people invested in content? Invested in their own work? Invested in a sense of self in the machine known as the university? Well, through relationships, discussions, challenges, and a general sense of the humanity (or even inhumanity) behind it all. If you can do that in elearning ? no matter what the tool ? I'd call that success.  All that said, I think online learning needs to be thought of as a different genre from face-to-face teaching at the same time, and this is where I believe I failed my online students this semester ? -and will have to work on this in coming iterations. I heard someone recently talk about Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" noting that that song was never truly intended to be performed live, it was very much a piece designed to be listened to on the stereo. And in concert rather than trying to perform the song, they simply played a recording of the song ? which at first seems some kind of betrayal. But in fact it was how this song was meant to be heard, it was a situation where the live performance was not necessarily privileged. When hearing that it kinda struck me that is how we should be re-thinking various elements of online courses ? what about the web works best ""live"" and what is best produced remotely in ""stereo"" ? can we differentiate the topography of the web and all its complexity more specifically so that we don't simply reduce a good online class to the same thing as a good face-to-face class? As of now it seems we have widely adapted the worst of the face-to-face classes ? -namely pure content transfer in the form of recorded lectures and pre-defined, cookie-cutter lessons dropped in and distributed by the fluorescent-lighted LMSs ? without deeply considering that what needs to be harnessed in this new genre of teaching and learning is the platform itself and the network which makes it vital ? -and lastly we need more disco balls in our online classrooms!  Looking at ds106, it is forward-thinking in many respects, including the collaborative course design, the student-generated content and the online, distributed nature of the course. What do you find are some of the challenges involved in innovating in elearning in this way?  ds106 rules. Let me get that out of the way first. Now, why does it rule? Well, it rules because it is a collaborative endeavor through and through. When Martha Burtis, Alan Levine, Tom Woodward, and I had our first, and only, brainstorming meeting in December we came up with some general guidelines, which you can read more about here. What we wanted to do is basically make ds106 as close to an uncourse as we could. Let students submit assignments and encourage them to do the assignments of others. Move away from stifling spaces like Elluminate for classes, and frame some kind of architecture that would work both for online and face-to-face students simultaneously.  We began realizing in that meeting how crucial a network like Twitter would be, and that turned out to be exactly right, Twitter was the glue for this class in so many regards ? it wouldn't have been the same without it in so many ways. We also discussed building in a game idea for assessment that I really liked, but we couldn't accomplish it as we conceived it this time around, but I will be reviving this idea over the Summer.  As for challenges, it was a bit overwhelming at first given how much we had to do in so little time, the brainstorming was less than a month before the course actually started. What's more, the challenge of pretending to read and comment on everything students do seemed frightening. But Alan Levine immediately noted that that is lunacy and at odds with the spirit of the course. ds106 isn't about any one figure giving everyone feedback, it is about a distributed network of feedback, and you get out of it what you invest in others. And that was key ? it took so much of the pressure off.  What's more, Martha Burtis is a genius when it comes to WordPress design and programming, and she whipped the architecture of the site up in no time. And she has documented that process here, here, and here. Not only that, but Tom Woodward really got the whole class started a month before it started by posting assignments and doing some unbelievably amazing work with animated GIFs. And therein lies the story of how this class started ? it happened with the work of many people ? a network emerging for a specific event and making it happen together. This class would have been not only a failure without the collaboration, but it really would have been impossible otherwise.  So the challenge is giving up some idea of property and control over the course. Letting others bring their awesome ideas to the table and let them execute them. People are creative and awesome, and if you let them go, they will amaze you. That is what happened in ds106, Martha and I simply asked for help and we got it in droves from some of the very best people in the field, and a whole lot of other people we didn't really know before we got this whole thing off the ground. So the challenges are letting go ? which is very hard ? but also bringing your network to bear on a course like this.  And this last point is important, I've been blogging for six years now and I have been on twitter for three (and the same goes for Martha). What's more, I have been extremely active in both domains ? that has a ton to do with how many people got involved and helped out. What so many others would have seen as idle chatter and navel gazing was in fact the single most important thing to getting ds106 get off the ground. So developing a network is both crucial and a major challenge because it takes a lot of hard work, and you have to invest a ton of time in cultivating relationships with people ? and even sacrificing a few.  So, for me, the greatest challenges of this class were already conquered by the time we started it cause I have no delusions of ownership of ideas, nor aspirations towards leadership. And I was already part of a very strong, open, and very fun online network that was down with the idea and ready to participate. And they really brought it hard all semester long ? it is quite amazing really.  One specific innovation that you have introduced during this current presentation of the course is radio ds106. What is radio ds106?  Here is the official line:  > It is a free form live streaming station that has been setup for this course, and it is being used as a platform to broadcast the work being created in the class, and a space for live broadcasts as well as for programming shows. The whole point of this experiment is to encourage any and all members of the course (as well as beyond it) to produce something real for anyone who wants to tune in. It's also provides a global, 24 hour/7 day-a-week happening for the creations of the course and much, much more. And more than anything, ds106 radio is place where anyone can submit their work and help program the course radio station in order to commune and share around works and ideas while at the same time making the web safe for democracy.  Unofficially, ds106 radio is a community radio station that emerged in week 2 or 3 of the course. It was not at all planned and it proved to be one of the most powerful ways of bringing various online participants into the mix. For me ds106 radio was a way to re-imagine online conversations and communities through the radio genre. It allowed many folks in the class to both perform in this space as well as to share a sense of who they are and the culture they are a part of. For me that was the amazing part of ds106 radio, it introduced a sense of people and their interests, ideas, and passions directly into the course, a kind of mainlining of personalities and tastes ? which I think is at the heart of any great course.  Brian Lamb has a really good post about his first impressions of ds106 radio here. Also, Zach Dowell frames how ds106radio is the best kind of professional development you can't buy for $500. You can read the ds106 radio about page which gets at some of the particular details behind the experiment ? but it really is a protean beast that is still finding its identity (which I think should be an ongoing condition). It has unleashed so many cool possibilities on the class it has almost been overwhelming. There has been a cadre of community members in ds106radio that aren't necessarily taking the course at all ? which I love ? and it has become a community within the community, and in many ways has its own identity and I'm pretty sure will far outlive any time bounded idea of the course. I can say a lot more, and will if requested, but I am hoping others in the ds106 radio community read this and add their thoughts and ideas, because they are avid. I am talking to you Dr. Garcia, Scottlo, Jared Stein, David Kernohan, Guilia Forsythe, Mikhail Gershovich, and many, any more!  How did the idea for radio ds106 come about?  All hail Grant Potter! And his post here gets at the emergence of ds106radio brilliantly. What's more, Grant Potter represents everything that is great about the web, he is constantly tinkering, experimenting, and playing ? he isn't interested in credit and all that crap, he just generally kicks ass and takes names on a regular basis. ds106radio is his brainchild, and it has been nothing but experimental gold for ds106 ? I can't thank him enough for all he has done for this course.  And his influence goes beyond the radio, his example got Tim Owens experimenting with a solution for ds106.tv ? and that has really come alive these last weeks.  And the take away? None of this would have happened if the course wasn't open and the networks weren't in place. I was introduced to Grant Potter by Brian Lamb ? and discovered Tim Owens through Tom Woodward ? there is a great web of connection and people that frame the infrastructure of our online lives, and a course like ds106 let's us discover it again ? while grafting on a common purpose to create cool things.  Were you able to look at examples of others who had tried something similar?  I was following Grant's lead through-and-through, he got us up and running, trained me how to operate the radio, and I was off and running. What's more I learned a ton about broadcasting software, simulcasting, basic radio etiquette, etc.  ? all on the fly. I am sure Grant has a ton of examples he pulled from, but I can't really speak to this ? I am radio green ? which means my learning curve has been astronomical.  That said, Brian Lamb has constantly raved about the freeform radio station out of Hoboken, NJ called WFMU since I've known him, and I think that was a kind of the guiding light in terms of the model, attitude, and aesthetic of ds106radio. What's more, Grant Potter blogged about that direct connection here ? so I can safely say WFMU is certainly the most obvious influence on ds106radio, but I'm sorry I can't think of others ? though I'm sure someone else will fill in the gaps.  What is the University of Mary Washington's orientation towards innovations in elearning and how did this impact on the setting up of radio ds106?  UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning has been dedicated to iterative experimentation with open source, web-based tools for more than seven years. We believe in the sandbox approach to technology, we get in there and experiment with the various tools and decide which would be the best for our community. ds106radio is very much inline with this ethos, though I can't say ds106radio started at UMW, nor is it hosted here ? we just provided the occasion. I think the approach we take is also demonstrated by edtech folks around the world, and ds106radio is an example of how our particular group is enriched by opening up the work we do to others.  What technology did you use to set up the radio station?  Grant Potter has a series of posts on this, and he really understands the underlying technology so I'll let him speak to the details. But the following posts may be of use:""  ""Distributed, freeform, collective webradio""  ""Papaya Broadcasting Settings""  ""Going Mobiel with #ds106radio""  ""#ds106radio: Peanut Butter and Jams""  What's more, Alan Levine has a great tutorial for using Nicecast (a way to broadcast to ds106radio from a Mac), Tim Owens has a tutorial for Ladiocast (also for Macs), Stephen Downes has one for the PC, and Mikhail Gershovich has a great tutorial for getting your system audio to run through Nicecast.  What considerations did you have when selecting the technology to use?  None, that was all Grant Potter ??  Do you use other online/social media in conjunction with radio ds106?  Without question the single best tool for the ds106radio to communicate has thus far been Twitter. It has been a place to let folks know you are going live, to share thoughts on a program, give folks feedback on their radio programs, let them know if you can hear them, run request radio shows, and just about anything else you can imagine. Twitter has been amazing for the class more generally, but particularly useful for framing the community of ds106radio. If you want to get a sense of this check out the hashtag #ds106radio. What's more, Zach Dowell's diagram of the technology for this class really illustrates how central Twitter has been to ds106 more generally.  What type of interaction occurs between this medium and others?  It depends, I think ds106radio, like I said earlier, is one community among many. It has been cross-broadcast with ds106.tv on a few occasions, but I would say that its biggest crossover with the other parts of the class are manifested on Twitter or in reflection pieces, tutorials, or set lists on the blogs.  What type of content is on ds106 radio, how is it made and who makes it and who listens?  There is all kinds of content, more than I can list here. But it ranges from music uploaded by anyone in AutoDJ to live DJ'd shows to storytelling to experimental music to theme days to field reports to discussions with moms to live broadcasting of courses to uploaded sets of music or remixes or mashups. People create bumpers, commercials, etc. It is really a wide range of freeform craziness. More and more we are seeing the push to live radio all the time, and given it is 24/7, that is hard, but it is happening remarkably more often these days. And I credit that to ds106radio's first lady Dr. Garcia ? she is relentlessly awesome in keeping this community together and on track ? every community needs this ? and she is amazing at what she does.  What learning objectives do you see radio ds106 as addressing?  None. It is an experiment, we had students do half hour radio projects during the audio portion of the course as a way to create for radio and think about alternative means of storytelling, but that was the only formal assignment for this space. The rest has been accomplished purely out of a shared sense of interest and community.  What's more, I think learning objectives are overrated. You can't teach a wrong class rightly.  You've referred to radio ds106 as an experiment, how has it fared so far in terms of expected outcomes?  It has exceeded my every expectation because I had none at all when this course started. ds106radio is an absolute bonus to everything else we had planned, and what is interesting is that the unplanned portion of this course with no objectives and no real expectations has become for many the most compelling. How do we make sense of that as educators?  Have there been any unforeseen positive aspects?  I think it has almost entirely been an unforeseen positive given that ds106radio was unforeseen from the beginning. But the biggest bonus has been that it allowed us to think about storytelling in a genre of communication, namely radio, that so many have suggested was dead with the incoming tide of the web. What it suggests is that it's not only potentially vibrant, but it is actually not that hard for anyone to do on the web. This is not radio necessarily, but webradio, and I think the power of the human voice to connect with others through a distributed, open network like ds106radio has been illuminating. What's more, it solved the conundrum of synchronous space. We wanted to avoid Elluminate at all costs given the overhead, it's owned by the scourge of elearning that is BlackBoard, and it generally reproduces the classroom environment in the most uninteresting, obedience-centered ways ? ds106radio provided a very cheap and powerful alternative that went well beyond a single-use tool.  Have there been any unforeseen negative aspects?  Yes, time! ds106radio has absolutely consumed my life for the last 10 or 12 weeks, and I have to re-introduce myself to my family. I have been obsessed with it, and that has pushed a lot of my energy towards the radio, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but for me it is hard because I am not very good at reigning in my obsessions and doing what I should. Other than that it has been pure gold.  Would you recommend a course radio station for other courses either at UMW or elsewhere? Why?  I'm not sure every course can sustain a radio station, and I think ds106radio is much bigger than the course. What I do think, however, is every university or college should have a radio station platform dedicated to teaching and learning. A place to feature work, let students report from the field, experiment with projects, etc. I think opening it up more broadly across a series of courses and a wider community would be far more practical and rewarding in the long run because one course manning a radio station is a ton of work ? and everyone who is part of ds106radio understands that. It helped that it was a crowd sourced radio station, but time is of the essence, and no one is making any money on this, what's more, no one is getting paid ? so it has to be come as you can.  What advice would you give to someone thinking of setting up a course radio station?  Well, I would suggest they have a strong network of folks that are interested, try not to over plan it, and be sure to integrate it meaningful into your course. But like I said above, if it isn't a priority, or you have to cover much more than just programming and creating content for a radio station, you might consider just using ds106radio (or some other open webradio if there is one) for those parts you want to broadcast ??  Is there anything else you would like to add regarding radio ds106 and elearning innovation?  I would just like to say that ds106radio has been amazing above and beyond the actual platform and community ? though those have been too ? because it has pushed me outside of my safety zone of blogs. I had been so singly focused on blogs for years ? which are awesome ? but when ds106radio (and then ds106tv) came along my whole vision was shifted. I realized that we don't only own the publishing platforms, but also the vertical and horizontal that are radio and TV. What happened in ds106 shouldn't be about a single course, rather it should be the realization that we as teachers and learners have the means to create amazing stuff with very little capital. The magic ingredient is people who form networks and communities that are brought together by the impulse to create cool stuff and have fun. This is an extremely powerful realization in my mind ? and one universities don't pay nearly enough attention to.  "Jim Groom,The ds106 99: #1 Rapid Prototyping the Mashup,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-ds106-99-1-rapid-prototyping-the-mashup/,4/13/2011,"I have to be honest, I have generally been exhausted by ds106. It is the best thing I have ever been part of professionally, but it has been kicking my ass pretty regularly for the last four months, so I went into class last night low energy, unprepared, and generally feeling like I was at mile 22 or 23 of this nonstop marathon. But I was not totally without a plan, in previous semesters I had done a lot with rapid prototyping during class time as a way to get everyone excited about the possibilities of something like audio, video, the mashup, or fan fiction. It's fun to give five or six groups of ds106 internauts the charge of creating something in less than an hour given what they have learned thus far. I've written about this before here, and last night I figured they had enough experience collectively with video that they could take on creating a video mashup in less than an hour.  I wanted to accomplish a couple of things here: 1) give them an introduction to the Internet Archive and the public domain, 2) help them think through the mashup by trying one before their assignment is due Saturday, and 3) help them realize what's possible working collaboratively and creating something in less than an hour. And it is always remarkable to me how low energy a project like this starts out while everyone is dragging ass and complaining, but by the end of class everyone is staying late and getting excited to watch everyone's work ? the creative process has its own very powerful energy not unlike the force in Star Wars.  So the charge was simple, use a video from the Prelinger Archive, specifically the Coronet Instructional Films, to make a mashup around the social etiquette films such as ""Are you popular?"" or ""Boys Beware."" There are a ton of 1950s instructional social etiquette videos ranging anywhere from hygiene to war to dating ? -and it's a revelation for everyone to see what a treasure trove of Americana history and culture the Prelinger Archive is. The mashups aren't masterpieces, but they pretty damn fun given the limitations imposed, and that for me is part of the creative process in ds106: fast, cheap and out of control. An added bonus was that I was able to help those who didn't know how detach audio, swap audio, clip video and audio, etc.  ? all things that wouldn't have been touched on if we didn't experiment together in the workshop model. This class should really be lab based. What's more, a couple of groups ran into a problems with their original idea and that for me was an excellent opportunity to talk one-on-one about what might and might not work when trying your hand at the mashup.  Anyway, enough talk, here are some of the products of this rapid prototyping of mashups experiment:  In Class Group Mashup from Jordan Kroll on Vimeo.  And there are at least two more, if they become available I'll update this post.  "Jim Groom,ds106: The Summer of Oblivion,http://bavatuesdays.com/ds106-the-summer-of-oblivion/,6/4/2011,"Videodrome: Dr. Brian Oblivion  Starting on June 20th there will be another round of ds106, this time an intensive, five week version that will run through July 21st. Currently we have 25 students registered for this course at UMW despite every attempt to scare them away with this pre-course email. Now there is no reason to try and scare anyone interested in taking the open, online version about the workload because you can do as little or as much as you want, and leave the rest. No apologies necessary, you do what you do ? only requirement is that you try and have fun doing whatever it is you do.  I come with no expectations for what this second go around will be in terms of numbers and participation from the open, online folks. I was blown away during the Spring by just how many folks brought it on a regular basis, and I'm not sure we can expect that his time around given it's during the dead of Summer and a far quicker, more intense version of the course, but making it open was the best thing that ever happened to ds106 ? so how could I not put out the invitation again. So come on in and make some art with us ? we would love to have you! What's more, I've found ds106 has been an amazing way to connect with new folks from around the world and I jump at the opportunity to keep that goodness going.  So, if you are interested do me the favor of filling out the form below so I can make sure your work syndicates cleanly from your blog. After that, just head over to ds106.us and register on that site and be sure to fill out as much of the profile information as possible, and be sure to include an avatar! That's it, easy as ds106 art!  Loadingƒ  I'll be sending out some details about the course along with the syllabus and calendar early next week. There will also be a series of tutorials on the course wiki for getting one's own web host, domain, and installing one's own WordPress blog. That said, as a preface to those forthcoming resources I'm introducing some new elements to the course this time around. We will be playing in Minecraft (minecraft.ds106.us) as a way to see how this space works for collaboration, machinima storytelling, and distributed communication within a virtual game world. Also, there will be a daily radio/TV broadcast by Dr. Brian Oblivion (featured in the animate gif above). I've decided to go through with both Minecraft and the alternative teaching identity. The former is a no brainer, this is a virtual world and given the class is entirely online how could we not experiment to see what this space might afford us? As for Oblivion, I wanted to push myself in this course to not only experiment with and challenge some of the ideas we have about the role of the professor, online learning, and mediated communication ? but I wanted to do this while reading Marshall McCluhan's work closely and using the course and my story within it as a way to think through and comment on his ideas. I figure if I am not pushing myself to explore and be consumed by this media then it would run counter to the whole reason for the course in the first place. So, there it is, ds106: The Summer of Oblivion ? but this analyzing is paralyzing, let's play this dang thing!  "Jim Groom,PSU #4life,http://bavatuesdays.com/psu-4life/,9/29/2011,"I was fortunate enough to visit the great folks at Penn State University last week. And it is amazingly to me that we found time between #drunkcasts on #ds106radio to sit down with the E-Portfolio crew, the Digital Commons crew, as well as an interview with Jamie Oberdick for a Daily Buzz episode.  The trip was a total blast and I have to thank both Cole Campelese and Brad Kozlek for making the trip so smooth. What's more, I have to acknowledge how locked and inspired the PSU edtech community truly is. For almost 8 hours in a variety of forms (i.e., interview, open discussions, presentation, etc.) we talked everything from eportfolios, ds106, WordPress, blogging platforms, as well as a few other things. Brad Kozlek has been ruminating on those discussions and I totally agree with him that frame an infrastructure at PSU (one of, if not the, biggest research university in the country) to crack the nut of enabling students to control their own space for learning, archiving, and reflection but feeding it out cleanly to a community or network effects is huge. We haven't fully got our heads around this, but I have no doubt that will change once PSU puts some it's seemingly boundless talent behind this issue.  I'll check in with the PSU folks to see if there is a link to the presentation video/audio, but in the meantime if you are interested in some of the conversations we had at PSU, check out Jamie Oberdick's interview below:  Daily Buzz PSU Interview  Update: And here is the video of the presentation at PSU titled ""A Domain of One's Own.""  "Jim Groom,This Week in ds106 (Episode 1),http://bavatuesdays.com/this-week-in-ds106-episode-1/,1/20/2012,"Hope your first week went well and was not too disorientating in terms of ds106. I wanted to send you a quick note to remind you of a few things.  Week 1 Assignments:      1) For the first week you have two assignments due: getting your web host and domain up and running as well as installing a WordPress blog  2) Doing at least 3 daily creates (required for registered students of section 1 at UMW) on the day they are due. You can find the daily create site here: http://tdc.ds106.us  This is laid out more specifically in the assignment post on my personal blog here: http://bavatuesdays.com/week-1-assignments-domain-webhost-the-daily- create-and-tuning-into-ds106/  Important: when you have setup your domain please send me the URL so I can be sure it syndicates into ds106.us and that it is set up correctly. This is due by Sunday, January 22nd. This takes time, don;t wait until the last minute.    Tuning into ds106   Keep in mind that not every ds106 face-to-face course will be streamed. I will stream as many as possible, but in general I will try and only stream the one's where there is a guest speaker or specific lecture. If you would like me to stream the workshops too let me know. Also, I have no problem if you decide to join the workshops that will happen on a weekly basis in person, but this is not required.  As I mention in the above assignment posts, you can tune into ds106 when it is live through live video stream here: http://dtlttoday.com/livehttp://dtlttoday.com/live or on the radio station which is linked from the front page of ds106.us.  This Week in ds106   Finally, the other instructor and I, Alan Levine, will be doing a weekly video on Monday getting everybody set for what's in store for the coming week as well as wrap-up of the week on Friday. This series will be called This Week in ds106, and hopefully will help you stay on track. You can see the first episode we did this afternoon below:  DS106 Week One Review from umwnewmedia on Vimeo.  Some important reminders and technical advice   A few reminders. Be sure to have your twitter, flickr, soundcloud, and youtube accounts setup as soon as possible Additionally, be sure you add at least 5 images immediately to your flickr account so it is recognized and they activate the feed. Accounts with less than 5 images do not have their feed activated right away.  Also, a number of UMW students have been reporting that the hosting page at Hover is caching on the local network so that it shows that your domain and webhost are still parked at Hover when in reality anyone from a different access point or on a different network can see your site, or at least the index page of your site. If your site has been stuck at your domain register for an inordinate amount of time have someone from a different location check your URL and have them tell you what they see.  CPanel and File Manager   In last night's face-to-face class we spent some time talking about CPanel, File Manager, Add-On Domains and PHPMyAdmin as a kind of overview to your web hosting account. I would love it if someone took the initiative to do an overview of any one of these elements of CPanel. One of the things I really encourage you all to do is explore and tinker with the web hosting account you have. See what you can do, try and break it eve, get a sense of what it means to manage your own little piece of the web.  "Tim Owens,A domain of one's own: rebooted.,https://blog.timowens.io/a-domain-of-ones-own-rebooted/,2/16/2012,"UMW and in particular the folks at DTLT have a long history of talking up the idea of ""a domain of one's own"" which basically is the philosophy that there is great power in putting responsibility for getting a domain space and in some ways becoming a sysadmin of webspace in the student's hands. It's a philosophy that we've put in to action semester after semester at ds106 and Martha continues in her digital identity course this semester. UMW Blogs provides a powerful first step in giving faculty, staff and students the power to publish to the web with ease, but the limitations of running just Wordpress, a specific subset of themes and plugins, makes the space...well limited. A student can buy a domain name and map it to UMW Blogs but ultimately when they leave UMW they're going to have to buy web hosting elsewhere and migrate all that data off. Wordpress doesn't make this terribly difficult, but what if there was a better way? It's funny how life repeats itself. After a powerful conversation over lunch today with my coworkers I started doing some research about where we've come and came across Jim's post all the way back in 2008 of the same title which details a vision for which the energy is now renewed. Technology, products, and services are sufficiently advanced to realize this dream once and for all, and it's time for UMW to make waves by becoming what might be the first university to issue domains to students upon enrollment. Now I'm not talking something like umw.edu/student/~whatever, I'm talking about the possibility of creating a system whereby students receive a gift card to Hover or some similar domain registrar where they get to claim what will be their space and then we provide the hosting completely free of charge for them to start building their digital identity online. Sound like an IT nightmare? It's easier than you think. After talking about the idea of a hosting plan that could support multiple users with a few others in my network we came upon MediaTemple's DV servers which offer the ability to not only host regular domains and provide space/bandwidth/etc but they can also be setup as a reseller that can offer domains their own control panel and segregated space. After talking about this for a few days we jumped the gun and went for it and Hippie Hosting was born. For me to be able to setup a site that can accept orders for hosting that automatically creates a webspace with control panel and all the bells and whistles of popular hosting provides....well that's incredible! I'm not even some IT sysadmin guru. I'm learning a lot already but this is something the university could easily provide. I'm sure we could find a domain registrar who would love to partner with us on it and maybe Media Temple would get in on the action as well. It would be incredibly powerful. And I see this going beyond simple web hosting. As Jim implies in his blog post and what has become even more apparent over the past few years at UMW is that providing students the path to create a digital identity and space online has huge academic implications that are much more far reaching than simply a place to put your files. This is exactly the discussion that people are having about the idea of ""e-portfolios"" redefined for the modern web. UMW can lead the way by providing students free of charge the ability to create their online identity and space, guide them through the process, support them every step of the way, and build it directly into the academic discipline of the curriculum taught here. This is an idea that has far-reaching implications and its time has arrived. For now if you're interested in being a part of the process and you're looking to stop supporting companies that suck, you can join our small band of merry misfits at Hippie Hosting. I'm waiving all fees and overriding all invoices when you sign up so we can get plenty of people involved and figure out a reasonable amount of money to keep it alive. Perhaps a pricing scheme could be worked out where people pay what they can and are willing to. How's that for a different kind of hosting provider? I'm excited for the possibilities this provides for UMW, DTLT, and beyond!  "Jim Groom,Eduglu Revisited: The Syndication Bus 2012,http://bavatuesdays.com/eduglu-revisited-the-syndication-bus-2012/,2/29/2012,"It's been more than a year since I've really thought, no less written about, the syndication bus as it relates to ds106. For any of you who might be new to the idea of the syndication bus, it's an approach to syndicating posts from various blogs or other social media sites into a space that can be filtered by tags or categories in order to help manage the flow of data so that it can be discovered, explored, and aggregated into a space that helps build community. On and off over the past 5 years I ? as well as many others for much longer ? have been obsessed with the idea of designing such a space. In many ways it's the philosophy that undergirds the design logic that made UMW Blogs a syndication rich platform for aggregating course sites, study abroad blogs, clubs and organization sites, etc.  So, it's interesting that George Kroner should tweet earlier today that a post back in 2007 contained a lot of interesting conversation about the idea of the syndication bus that really didn't really mature until the last year ? -which is something I hadn't thought too hard about until he tweeted it. Fact is, if I can step outside of the black hole of time, energy, and love that is ds106 for a moment and think about something else professionally, anything else in fact, it would be apparent that we have started to approximate this syndication bus pretty effectively, cheaply, and easily for most folks who can install a vanilla WordPress blog ? -which is pretty amazing when you think about it. As a technical framework ds106 is an impressive and fairly simple approach to enacting eduglu quite apart from any idea of a particular <del>cult</del> class. It really can be broken down into three simple elements at the moment ? -with a fourth coming soon:  1) FeedWordPress to Syndicate in 500+ blogs to the main ds106.us site (the automation of feed aggregation still needs to be perfected to save time and energy).  2) Martha Burtis's work to create an Assignment repository (much of it done with Gravity Forms as opposed to Google Docs in the old method).  3) Tim Owens's The Daily Create site is cobbled together with freely available plugins, and documented here.  4) And still to be built is the remix engine that will frame a fourth space wherein students from the various classes participating in ds106 can remix each others work. More on this in another post.  If you go back to the post that George Kroner mentions above you'll realize that a comment by Brian Lamb quoting George Siemens is the genesis of this syndication bus talk that the above elements are all in some way a reflection of:  > ƒschools should be in the business of managing data flows rather than in supporting an end to end user experience. We can only dream what might result if the energy going into the campus-wide LMS's would go into creating flexible and easy to use ""syndication buses"" or to addressing pragmatic instructor challenges to using the ""small pieces"" approach  ?  things like student management tools, gradebooks etc. And what about providing the service of institutional archiving and data backups to mitigate the risks of using third party tools?  This remains, to this date, the tightest and clearest expression of what I have been working towards for the last five years, a message the Chronicle's piece on my work really can't articulate because it pre-dates EDUPUNK or ds106 or anything else that has me directly facing off with the LMS, BlackBoard, or some other easily polarized, relatively facile issue. The syndication bus is anything but a simple ""for or against"" the LMS argument, rather it's an entirely different way for universities to imagine information, data, connections, and the teaching and learning enterprise as it interfaces with IT. This to me still remains the model I think we should be working towards, and that's why it's a bit discouraging for me to see the conversations turn almost entirely towards the idea of the unbound, institutionally liberated MOOCs that are becoming all the rage as the market is heating up (think Stanford, Khan Academy, Udacity, etc.).  As I note in a comment on George Siemens recent post here, while MOOCs represent a remarkable approach to new ways of imagining learning, they are anything but refined as of yet. And the whole idea of Massive in relation to open, online courses is still deeply problematic as an approach to teaching and learning ? it's far too easy to divorce yourself from the social relations that define the course. Rather than so quickly trying to capitalize on this wave and create the next set of branded, corporate delivery mechanisms for content, seems to me we should instead be working to cultivate and iterate through a truly social, interactive, and peer-to-peer based web premised on syndication, aggregation and open tools that seems to be in danger. They remain a threat to the heart of the open web by undermining the power of social interaction through turnkey, packaged content approaches to online learning that Stephen Downes outlines brilliantly at the end of this post/interview.  I'm all for continued experimentation with open, online courses that work, and the impetus to educate as much of the world as possible through open knowledge is something I absolutely get behind. But the fact is we still have a critical mass at brick and mortar universities and the move to the venture capital, startups for these badge-based universities seems a quick way for a few people to make a lot of money while simultaneously waging war on already underfunded public institutions. What's more, it would seem to me downright stupid for the vast majority of educators and students to follow a path that is pretty nakedly framing its business model around a wholesale Wal-Marting of higher education through scale and reach, not through quality, interaction, and livable wages. The implications on society run deeper than just a poorly educated population, if that doesn't cut deep enough. I can't see how this will end well for the majority of us. If Candace Thille's idea (not nearly powerful enough to call a vision) for online learning in higher education isn't deeply horrifying to you in its ability to displace relationships and interaction that define an education experience with a strip mall approach to course design then you just aren't paying attention. There are no shortage of people who want to gut higher ed in much the same way they have gutted K12 ? and they are doing a fine job of it, they don't need our help.  So, what is getting me excited these days is that this vision that has been driving so many of us for the last number of years is taking on a new life here at UMW. We're in the early planning stages of making these syndication buses ? which is exactly what the ds106 site is when you think about it ? a reality for ""managing data flows"" of students and faculty around UMW who will be managing their own data in their own spaces. The idea is to provide everyone with a domain, web hosting and a platform of their own from which they will create their presence, experiment with the tools, and and build on the experience ? not unlike what we have done at the course level in ds106. In fact, what we are talking about is a campus wide realization of Gardner Campbell's Personal Cyberinfrastructre across the university. Tim Owens outlines the idea of A Domain of One's Own Rebooted, and given we have hundreds, if not thousands, of students and faculty who already use WordPress and manage their own domains on UMW Blogs, this seems the logical next step in further pushing the community to ownership of their digital identity. Fact is, UMW finds itself in a unique position to pull this off. Given the amazing work so many of our faculty do on a regular basis in this regard ?  it quickly becomes apparent that the infrastructutal, technical, curricular, and teaching chops are all aligned, it is a perfect storm and we are about to imagine the syndication bus on a level that makes the life of the mind of the university that much more present, tangible, discoverable, and preservable.  Who wants to head to a start-up? They don't have the freedom to innovate in this way? The investment the state make in higher ed in Virginia is so that we can help shape a new model of thinking about teaching and learning in the 21st century that is not first and foremost premised upon profit and making a few people significantly richer than the rest of us, but rather about interrogating the digital culture we find ourselves immersed in so that we can better understand the implications for civilization and humanity more generally. That is why we work where we do. That ethic needs to not only survive, but procreate wildly ? we've begun thinking theirs is the only way to go about our business when deep down inside we know it's not.  "Jim Groom,"You know what, DTLT is pretty sick right now",http://bavatuesdays.com/you-know-what-dtlt-is-pretty-sick-right-now/,3/29/2012,"Image credit: Kate Geraets ""We Rock"" (click image for link)  The semester has been flying by, here we are in week 10, two-thirds through and I have to say we here at UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies are moving at a pretty amazing clip. It's as if everything has clicked, and we all ""can still jack in and know what do to."" It's like a team that just starts to hit their stride, and when they do it all just feels so natural. A beautiful sense of peaking where everything around you slows down and you can just see what's coming next, and nail it. Working at UMW's DTLT right now is a rare professional privilege, and I find myself racing to work everyday to ride that high. But all of this might just sound like sugar coated cheerleading, so let me layout what exactly has got me so excited about working at DTLT right now.  UMW's Online Learning Initiative   Steve Greenlaw is leading up an initiative at UMW that I think is one-of-kind when it comes to online learning. UMW's Online Learning Initiative, amongst other things, is trying to organize and formalize some of the amazing digitally-based work happening at UMW into the foundation for an approach to teaching fully online courses across the disciplines by focusing on bringing the principles of a liberal arts education to web-based learning, i.e., interaction, community, self-directed-learning, intimacy, etc. We believe that University of Mary Washington is in a unique position to design and teach courses which instill the values of a liberal arts & sciences experience into a fully online environment that are at least comparable quality to our traditional face-to-face courses ? and that's what we're doing.  Along with Steve, Martha Burtis, myself, and just recently Alan Levine (but more on him in a bit) are working with a cohort of nine faculty to get at least eight fully online courses up and running this Summer and Fall. It's extremely exciting, and the approach is in many ways groundbreaking ? for the most part these are not just online courses, they are courses that are on and of the web and that for me is where the excitement comes in.  Additionally, the actual process for proposing courses, reviewing those proposals, and sharing ideas and commentary has been happening on a series of sites Martha Burtis designed that are nothing short of amazing. Last Summer, the faculty involved were asked to consider in-depth the value system of a liberal arts community. We then started exploring how these values might be integrated into the online courses they were developing to avoid the all too common problem of trying to graft the face-to-face on the online space. Their final course proposals were based around a series of core liberal arts values (you can see the Liberal Arts values I keep referring to here) we were all in agreement on and then each proposal was reviewed by two internal reviewers, one UMW student, and two external reviewers .  The review process was streamlined by Martha's submission site for proposals here, as well as the ultimate reviewing and commenting site that was done in digress.it for commentary and feedback for each of the course proposals. You can see two examples of these course reviews here and here. Finally, she has come up with a site that allows the faculty from UMW, and beyond, to share quick teaching ideas with one another based on the core values of UMW's Online Learning Initiative, it has the potential to be an absolutely amazing resource for sharing ideas around teaching in general, but teaching online specifically. (You can see the repository of teaching ideas here.) The long and the short of the OLI is this: a lot of universities and colleges have gone at online learning as cost saving, convenient, efficiencies for the university (all of which we know we can provide well)  ? what we are interested in experimenting with in the OLI are the interfacing of the technology and people at UMW to actually make online courses social, interactive, and intimate spaces for teaching, learning, and sharing that augment the face-to-face experience at UMW ? and further coalesce the community.  Domain of One's Own Rebooted  If the OLI wasn't enough, we also have a project that is near and dear to my heart building some serious steam on campus. Tim Owens came on board in July, and he has been batting about .450 every since. He's a machine. He single- handedly re-invigorated the group around the Domain of One's Own project and has owned it since, and if all goes well we'll be committing to a pilot for this Summer and Fall that will provide anywhere from 200-400 students with a web host and domain of their own for the entirety of the next academic year and beyond (with sites on the whole Freshman class for 2013). Let me say that again, if all goes well we will be committing to a pilot for this Summer and Fall that will provide anywhere from 200-400 students with a web host and domain of their own for the entirety of the next academic year and beyond. How sick is that? What's more, it will have specific curricular and departmental hooks around campus and across disciplines. It's not a done deal yet, but just the idea that we are even this close to such a concept becoming a reality on campus is an absolute coup in my mind.  Alan Levine   Oh yeah, and by the way, Alan Levine is now an instructional technologist at UMW. Let me say that again, Alan Levine is now an instructional technologist at UMW! Are you kidding me? How sick is that?! We are rich as kings, and can you imagine being a student at UMW and having Alan Levine coming in to talk to you about using WordPress for a portfolio?  ? or working with a professor to imagine the possibilities for Digital Storytelling or a PirateBox?  ? or you name itƒ.it's an absolute dream come true for me to be able to work so closely with Alan, and I know for a fact I am not alone in this sentiment.  A New Media Shop   Andy Rush has taken a lot of shit from us for years for being the New Media guy here at UMW ? what is ""New Media"" again we constantly ask? But as usual his deceptive searching for his flow and rhythm is purely cover for setting the standard and direction for the group. Not only did he turn us on to the video kit and the initial possibilities for live streaming that Tim Owens ran with for DTLT Today (you remember that quiant little site?), but he's now collaborating with Alan Levine on top notch video projects like this, developing comprehensive and brilliant resources for our students to navigate the complex work of digital media like working with digital audio and video. He's got all of us excited about the new Final Cut Pro, and he's producing regular resources like this awesome guide to ripping, shrinking, and copying DVDs. En fuego.  Canvas   Oh yeah, did I fail to mention we moved to Instructure's Canvas as our institutional LMS this year as well? If I failed to mention it, it's because Lisa Ames has been so amazing at running this transition and seeing to it that our faculty are happy with this new system that we basically introduced overnight as our previous Online Learning Coordinator and LMS administrator took off two weeks befor the migration. A Herculean task that provides yet another source of stability and service on UMW's campus that allows so much of the innovation to thrive.  UMW's Website on WordPress   One more thing, before I forget, UMW's website is now running entirely on WordPress. It is a multi-network setup, and the whole thing is beautiful. It was all possible by the brilliant work of Cathy Derecki and Curtiss Grymala, and this process deserves a whole series of posts and discussions, but one quick thing to take away from: as a result of Cathy and Curtiss's work we are contributing directly to the WordPress community as state workers. This idea of building the commons as part of our jobs is coming to fruition more and more everyday at UMW, and it is an amazing thing.  And I just know there's more, but this post is too long already ??  "Jim Groom,Masters of Our Domain Names: UMW to Pilot Domain of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/masters-of-our-domain-names-umw-to-pilot-domain-of-ones-own/,4/1/2012,"What's gotten lost in all the attention around the ds106 Kickstarter is the fact that on Friday DTLT sat down with UMW's Chief Information Office, the inimitable Justin Webb, to work out the details for an initial pilot launch of a Domain of One's Own at UMW for 200 to 400 students starting this Summer and continuing throughout the 2012/2013 academic year.  What does this mean? It means we'll be providing personal domain names and web hosting for anywhere from 200-4000 students that will be used in a series of courses over the the coming year. This is born out of the idea that we want to help students consider taking responsibility for their online identity, as well as explorE the implications of what it might mean for them to take control of their work and manage their own portfolios (howe ver we understand that term). The idea that we can do this in partnership with the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) just reinforces how important giving students control over their online identity is at UMW. What's more, none of this could have even been considered on such a scale without Justin Webb's support and understanding of just how important this is to the evolution of UMW's vision of teaching, learning and instructional technologies.  What's more, if this pilot is successful we'll be considering giving every incoming Freshman in the 2013/2014 academic year their own domain and webhost to experiment with. So this emerging pilot is the test run for a much bigger and more radical approach to make students nodes within a larger network of the intellectual community that in many ways would transform UMW Blogs into a framework not unlike ds106's site for a variety of classes, communities, etc.  Now this is exciting!  "Jim Groom,Innovation as a Communal Act,http://bavatuesdays.com/innovation-as-a-communal-act/,4/12/2012,"Toban Black's ""Policing and Community""  One of the things I've been wrestling with since ds106 went open and online back in Spring 2011 is how to represent innovation as a communal, rather than an individual, phenomenon. And this topic seems particularly relevant now that I have been asked to write something for the Chronicle of Higher Education's ebook follow-up to the ""12 Tech Innovators"" article in which I was named one of the lucky 12. As much as I try and downplay it, I have to recognize that I've directly benefited from being crowned one of the 12 tech innovators in higher ed. I've been asked to give talks at various colleges, and there's been a fair amount of professional praise and recognition from colleagues and administrators both within and beyond the University of Mary Washington (UMW). I'd be lying if I said a part of me doesn't really appreciate and relish the recognition, but at the same time I have to acknowledge it alienates me a bit from the communities that are responsible for my designation as an innovator in the first place. And while this tension is not necessarily new to me given the eruption around the term EDUPUNK back in 2008, it does remain an uncomfortable space that over time I've learned to embrace to the degree it solidifies and even furthers the work we do at UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT).  I also understand that as a result of this I've become somewhat of a figurehead for the amazing work Gardner Campbell and Chip German started at UMW seven or eight years ago. Work that has engendered projects such as UMW Blogs, ds106, and the soon to be realized Domain of One's Own  ? all of which were born from ideas and conversations amongst an amazing core of people at DTLT I've worked with over the last seven years: Martha Burtis, Jerry Slezak, Andy Rush, Patrick Murray-John, Tim Owens, and most recently Alan Levine. What's more, this doesn't even begin to cover the amazing faculty at UMW. There are so many that I couldn't begin to credit them all, but I should at least recognize early pioneers of UMW Blogs like Mara Scanlon, Steve Greenlaw, Jeff McClurken, Claudia Emerson, Carole Garmon, Jeremy LaRochelle to name a few. On top of that there are literally thousands of UMW students that continue to make UMW Blogs (an open, educational publishing platform) a vibrant intellectual community that was also a blast to browse and read.  When you look closely enough at the innovative work of any one person you quickly realize that it's built around and on top of the work of a much larger community. And while I understand it's simpler to enshrine a single individual for an achievement, I also know from personal experience that it often obfuscates the deeply social and distributed relations that make any of it possible ? and that remains a deep problem with the focus on credit and reward in the culture that we live in, our current educational system exemplifying the worst of that ethos.  But in an attempt to avoid being totally self-effacing, which is terribly out of character for me, I'll say that one of the things I've brought to both UMW Blogs and ds106 was the willingness to promote and champion the work happening around a series of seemingly dislocated ""academic"" acts. What was happening in UMW Blogs, and later ds106, was no longer simply an educational exercise in creative solipsism destined to the dustbin of LMS history, but rather a brave new interfacing of the ideas of students and faculty with the wondrous, wide open world of the web, and that alone was magical. My role in this was to yell and scream on my blog how awesome all that work was and how amazing that it's all just sitting out there on the open web for anyone to read, comment on, and re-use. UMW Blogs was not so much an attempt to replace the LMS as it was a new space to foster community on campus by opening up the awesome work our faculty and students were doing to each other and the world beyond. What's more, it led to us thinking differently about our role as a public institution by sharing the work and resources our community creates publicly.  As of today UMW Blogs gets almost 5 million page views a year from all around the world, and as a result we've effectively become an open, free resource which in turn changes the way we think about everything we do on a regular basis ? and it takes an entire community to effect such a shift in the culture. There's both hubris and humility in the leap UMW took to open: you have to believe in the work that's happening within the community (which I certainly do!) while at the same time be prepared to be openly critiqued as a result (which I don't think is a bad thing).  All of which brings me to ds106, the open, online digital storytelling class that I started teaching at UMW in Spring 2010. When it was opened up to the larger, online community in Spring 2011 I quickly realized just how much more powerful a class can be when it harnesses a community of people beyond the confines of a course (and that ability to harness a community for ds106 was made possible by years spent cultivating a network of colleagues). ds106 may have started as a class I taught at UMW, but it is much more than that now. It is a creative community of people who want to make things, share them, and give feedback to others. Watching a class transform into a community is an amazing thing to behold, but my part in that is limited to the willingness to let go of my role at the center of it. My innovation in many ways is letting the open, online community take over, by trusting the unplanned collisions of ideas, by embracing the experiments that emerged, and by continuing to promote and champion the work of students and faculty at UMW and beyond.  More than anything else I'm a community organizer, and what I do is not premised on technical prowess, individual genius, or some notion of visionary leadership ? but rather the belief, born of personal experience, that people want to be part of a fun, creative community that feeds into the work they do in every facet of their personal and professional life. That is what ds106 is and continues to be, and people like Alan Levine, Martha Burtis, Grant Potter, Giulia Forsythe, Tim Owens, Ben Rimes, Dr. Garcia, Zack Dowell, Tom Woodward, Rowan Peter Peter Rowan, Todd Conaway, to name just a few, are the folks that made ds106 more than just a class, they made it a community of creative practice. I may have started a class called CPSC 106 at UMW in Spring 2010, but I have only a modicum of responsibility for the community that is ds106 ? that could only happen because a group of people came together and opened themselves up to one another. They shared who they are, what they know, what turns them on, and as a result a community was born. And it seems to me now that every class should be such a community, every class should aspire towards becoming a community. That is the dream, that is why we do what we do. ds106 has become the realization of what school can and should be, and for me that is the real innovation and it can't be attributed to any one person ? it can only be attributed to the age old, and seemingly forgotten, innovation of communities coming together to help one another out.  "Jim Groom,UMW featured in ELI's 7 Things about New Learning Ecosystems,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-featured-in-elis-7-things-about-new-learning-ecosystems/,5/3/2012,"UMW is featured in this month's Seven Things You Should Know Series by ELI focusing on Navigating the New Learning Ecosystem. What's interesting is that this is not the first time UMW has been featured in the 7 Things series, in fact it's the fourth time since 2009. We were featured in the article on PLEs, WordPress, and MOOCs  ? and that is certainly cool and I am excited and all that. But what confounds me is whenever UMW staff and faculty submit presentations to ELI's annual conference we seem to be on the pay-no-mind list. If we're the innovators ELI seems to regularly have said we are again and again for the last three years ? and I think we are all that and more ? then start showing us a little love.  UMW is kicking major ass in the Instructional Technology field right now ? and has been for years, no circling the drain here ? and the Domain of One's Own is going to turn it all up to eleven. If you want to spotlight a university CIO right now, turn your eyes to UMW's Justin Webb who has the vision and willingness to experiment with all this and actually make it happen at Mary Washington. Is ELI looking for a Rookie of the Year instructional technologist? Get a load of the work Tim Owens has done to bring the pieces for a domain of one's own together for this to be a more than just a dream ? all this while balancing live video streaming on the cheap and makerbot madness! There is a new Sheriff in town when it comes to instructional technologies, and her name is UMW's DTLT. RESPECT OUR AUTHORITAY!  "Jim Groom,Faculty Academy 2012: Under Disruption,http://bavatuesdays.com/faculty-academy-2012-under-disruption/,5/9/2012,"A week from today Faculty Academy with be doing its 17th tour of duty at UMW. It's become a mainstay on campus, and it's become one of the few events where the teaching and learning that happens all year on campus gets featured publicly. It's an awesome event, and every year as it approaches I once again realize that it's a means to reflect on the amazing stuff happening on campus while at the same time providing an opportunity to think about what might be next.  This year we are actually bringing the conference back to the Mary Washington College campus (it's been held at the Stafford Campus for the last five years), and given we're in the new renovated Monroe Hall we figured we'd experiment a bit with the conference. Rather than starting off with presentations, we're actually gonna be kicking off the conference with a media carnival that will feature a wide range of new media we've been experimenting with this year. So we will be setting up a different featured technology across 4 rooms: 3D printing with the makerbot; internet radio; the live streaming video kit, and real-time graphic visualization. The carnival should be a blast, and I expect it will be an exciting way to get the conference started, get people walking around, discovering things, and socializing all the while. I'll be part of the internet showcase, and I am going to steal a page from Grant Potter and Brian Lamb's book at Open Ed last year and wander around the conference and interview people on the radio so the folks in the showcase room can hear the possibilities ??  What's more, our plenary speakers Giulia Forsythe and Grant Potter will be running at least two of those four showcase sessions and addressing the UMW community about Visual Literacy and the Adjacent Possible respectively. I'm fired up to be fortunate enough to have both Giulia and Grant come to UMW and inspire our faculty and staff to be as amazingly creative, open, and engaged as these two are, they walk a mean walk!  In between plenary sessions and the keynote (which I'll get to in a second), the meat of the conference happens featuring a variety of presentations from UMW's faculty. I think the sessions this year promise to be far more interactive and conversational given that more than half the submissions have been for panels. What's more, at lunch time both days we'll be featuring two major initiatives for the coming year: during Wednesday's lunch Jeff McClurken will be framing the idea for a Digital Studies program at UMW and on Thursday Tim Owens, Martha Burtis, and Justin Webb will be framing the Domain of One's Own project . I'm excited to get the conversational opened up more broadly for both of these initiatives, they're awesome.  And last, but certainly not least, keynoting this year's conference we have NYU professor of Fine Arts David Darts delivering a talk titled ""When I Hear the Word Culture, I Reach for My Source Code: The Struggle for Freedom and Control in the Digital Age"" (and if that title isn't cool enough follow the link and read the description!). [A quick aside, I think this is the first year that every invited speaker is Canadian ? what is this world coming to! :] This particular group of speakers at this years conference all have a very real and important edge to the work they are doing in this space: they want it open, they want it free, and they want it now! It is gonna be a sick one, and they all will bring the A-game down on this motherƒ..anyway, I got the chance to speak with Darts this past fall thanks to Grant Potter, and if you want to have an idea of some of the awesome you are in for, listen to David Darts describe his work with the Pirate Box which is one of his many provocations in the space of technology and teaching to challenge the commodification of the web as product and champion it as a space for freedom and possibility. Click the link below.  David Darts on his PirateBox Project  Oh yeah, did I mention Faculty Academy is totally free and I'm having a party at my house to cap it all off on Thursday night? How can you not come? Register here and be there, hippies!  "Jim Groom,"Networks within Networks: Humans, Technologies, and Metaphors",http://bavatuesdays.com/networks-within-networks-humans-technologies-and-metaphors/,5/24/2012,"I've heard Gardner Campbell talk at length about Networks of Networks as a way to describe what's happening in a course like his own New Media Studies or ds106. You can listen to him wax poetic on the concept in this talk given to ds106 back in January of 2011. The idea here is that rather than understanding courses like these as MOOCs in terms of massive, broadcast learning experiences, they become localized, fractal relationships that form a loose, yet dynamic, community born out of the web (not unlike the metaphor Mike Caulfield has been exploring with Inter Library Loan and online learning here). I love this idea, and for me it's a jumping off point for beginning to understand scale in new, more complex and compelling ways. The idea of numbers is compelling only insofar as you are trying to monetize those numbers, the figures of fractal course frameworks and transformative learning networks are much harder, though not impossible, to assess because it begins to outline the contours of humanity in these courses. In fact, the very idea of constantly using and re-using new relationships between ideas to explain these technologies seems distinctly human ? but I have to admit I don't speak dog ??  The occasion for thinking about the Networks of Networks idea came while playing around with Jeff Mcclurken's ds106 blog last night. And let me say it's awesome to see Jeff playing around with ds106, and his reasons for doing so are exemplary ? walking the walk is always awesome. What's more, mcclurken.org is actually a mapped network on UMW Blogs, not a mapped domain but a mapped network, and the difference is significant. Jeff can build a series of sites within his own domain that remain within the larger network of UMW Blogs, a network of networks that anyone and everyone inside (or outside of UMW Blogs) can create. As we move forward with the Domain of One's Own project (which is a done deal and provides 400 faculty and students their own domain and web hosting the first year) we can start approaching the idea of setting up these spaces as networks of thought and interaction rather than the more static connotation of a site.  What I ïve always loved about WordPress is as a technology it provides a solid metaphor for the concepts of networked learning, web-based platforms, and distributed openness ? it's not surprising either because it's an application of and on the web ? a result of years of web thinking, to quote Jon Udell. So when I was fixing a bug in Jeff's network that was preventing comments on the site (basically the Cookies for Comments plugin had a rewrite in the .htaccess file that was borking all comments on networks other than UMW Blogs) it occurred to me that Jeff's mcclurken.org is not just a mapped site, but a network of his work that other faculty and students can also create. From there the question of how we think about syndicating and aggregating these networks so that they make sense and provide possibilities for serendipitous discovery. This is just one of many questions that we have to grapple with in regards to the Domain of One's Own pilot that we are starting at UMW. Let's not force people to use the web hosting as much as we let them decide from a menu of options for mapping on an external service, networking on UMW Blogs, creating their own, etc.  Image credit: Scott Schrantz's ""Monterey Bay Aquarium""  More than anything though, the macguffin that will be driving my thinking for the next year is how can we use aggregation and syndication to bring individuals, courses, and departments to the umw.edu website in a seamless way so that our university's WordPress install can leapfrog UMW Blogs and become the public platform for syndicating and aggregating the activity around the community in order to demonstrate the life of the mind at UMW and beyond. This is an idea Cathy Derecki and Curtiss Grymala have been pushing for a while, and I outlined it at a recent talk I gave at Penn State University that the great Brad Kozlek was kind enough not only to attend, but also to take pretty comprehensive notes. The ""university website is not a brochure ? but a fish tank providing a view into the activity of community,"" and the fact that UMW is soon to have numerous levels of engagement at the individual, course, and department level will allow us to start imagining what this might look like in terms of representing the work being done throughout the community in some simple, dynamic, and enagaging ways on the web.  "Jim Groom,"UMW Blogs, a.k.a. Old Faithful",http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-blogs-a-k-a-old-faithful/,6/22/2012,"Me and UMW Blogs are going on 5 years this Summer, she's is the baddest of the bad and meanest and leanest of the mean and lean. She's a veritable titan of her kind, she's an educational publishing platform of the very best kind, and she's turning five. Five years ago from roughly May through August we brought together the early MistyLook themed WPMu and MediaWiki hybrid out into this wasteland of bad BlackBoard installs, and we shone a light.  A light of good publishing practices, a site for everyone regardless of his or her class status, and course spaces that actually looked good. We were already dreaming of fancy syndication, course aggregation, and a space attractive and user friendly enough that you would actually want to have a stake in it. It worked, five years later we have more than 6500 sites and 8500 users, and that number has steadily increased over these past five years. We run heavy traffic sites like UMW Bullet and EagleEye, or blogs for alumni 3 and 4 years out. We have aggregated blog posts from more than 40 UMW students who have written about their travels around the world, and some class sites that imagine a whole new use for online space discussion, tags and the community in the virtual. There are student created research sites I'd put up against any university's publicly open and shared work. Not to mention more than 35 original literary journals created by UMW students.  It's been an amazing space to watch emerge and grow into a distributed and highly active, yet loosely bound, community of classes, students, faculty and staff. I continue to feel honored to be a part of it. Oddly enough, I also feel further and further away from it, so much happens there in a single day I can't really keep track, we also have hundreds of plugins and themes, it's a vertiable laboratory doubling as an enterprise system, it's truly remarkable in that regard. We had almost 100% uptime this past academic school year, and save some recent brute force attacks these past two weeks, it has been a model for both reliability and possibility within a university platform.  Now I'm gonna talk numbers for a second because I continue to be blown away by them. This year alone we have more than 1.2 million unique visitors from all over the world and 4 million page views! This is mind blowing, umw.edu is a veritable brand with 100 years of history behind the idea and it gets 14 million a year. We've been doing open education out in the open for 5 years without packaging it ? it's an ongoing happening that others around the web can tap into, it is a model of online education that is not separated from a time, place, and most importantly the people that shape it. I love this system! It's the proto-type for our upcoming Domain of One's Own pilot, and it continues to evolve as an integral space wherein we all work.  What's more, as Notorious B.I.G. would have said if he was in my shoes, ""Mo traffic, mo problems."" We've been getting brute force attacked this last week, and Zach Davis, per usual, comes up big and writes us a script to block too many attempts on the login page, which has been pulling us down. Such issues come with age, and it couldn't have happened at a better time, but it also makes sense to share out Zach's solution here. And to Zach's credit, this is a someone trying to hack into WP, and this i where some expertise on our side for sys admining would give him Zach some freedom and force us to take a bit more responsibility. And while I want to in my heart of hearts, I'm not that good ? and we can only run enterprise sites like UMW Blogs and the quickly emerging ds106.us successfully for so long until we start needing people who are good, who do it regularly, and know how to admin WordPress properly ? I can hack my way through but it is ugly and I'll be the first to admit that my skills are not world class in this department ??  If you are having mini-DDOS attacks and your WordPress site is crashing as a result, then what follows may be very useful to you thanks to the great Zach Davis who got the original idea for this wp-login brute force login attack solution from this awesome blog post:  > I've done a number of things. I've tightened the firewall, tweaked the modsecurity rules, reduced the number of apache processes available to the server, and installed an apache module called DOS Evasive. All of these will tighten things up, so keep an ear our for users having problems. We may need to loosen restrictions at some point.  >  >   >  > I don't want to have to keep worrying about this server, which is crashing a few times per day, so I've gone ahead and implemented a solution to this brute force problem. I've added a modsecurity rule to apache that looks like this:  >  > `# This has to be global, cannot exist within a directory or location clause . . .  SecDataDir /usr/local/apache/logs/data  SecAction phase:1,nolog,pass,initcol:ip=%{REMOTEADDR},initcol:user=%{REMOTEADDR}`  >  > <Location /wp-login.php>  # Setup brute force detection.  >  > # React if block flag has been set.

On an unsuccessful login, WordPress displays the login page with a regular 200 header. The rule tracks how many 302 headers a user gets while visiting the wp-login.php page and, if they exceed <del>15</del> 10, it blocks the IP for 5 minutes. I tailed the mod security log and the request log at the same time and saw another attack come in (they are coming in constantly; within 5 minutes of blocking an IP, I see more requests, often as many as 3-4 per second from the same IP).  >  > We need to watch this closely and make sure people can still login to WordPress. Normally I would want to test this before deploying it to production, but in this case I think it's more important to get things locked down and then adjust as necessary. Please make sure that logins still work and let me know if you experience any problems.  How many of you get support like that from your host? It's amazing, and this reminds me just how integral Zach has been to all of UMW's successes with UMW Blogs, here's to you hippie ? it's been an awesome 5 years and sooner or later we will let you out of our experimental prisoner. Nobody makes the bava like the Davis, NOBODY!  "Jim Groom,"UMW's Website Poised to become Syndication Hub, and by Extension Relevant",http://bavatuesdays.com/umws-website-poised-to-become-syndication-hub-and-by-extension-relevant/,7/23/2012,"More than a week ago Cathy Derecki and Curtiss Grymala took me through some of the work they have been doing on umw.edu ? which has been a multi-network WordPress install for almost a year now. The ideas here build upon this post I wrote over the weekend about aggregating into umw.edu from my personal blog. Now that the campus is getting used to WordPress as the campus-wide publishing platform for our website, it seems high time to start pushing the envelope a bit to see if we can't finally realize a aggregated and distributedly authored web site that truly exposes the work happening around campus for all to see.  To that end, I think we're ready to move umw.edu beyond the brochure that has come to characterize university and college websites more generally. How relevant is that approach in the web-based ecosystem of dynamic information we all exist within? Here at UMW we want to integrate the life's blood of course blogging, social media, and distributed publishing into the fabric of our university's website. And based on the development Cathy and Curtiss have been doing we are all but ready to start. You can see an example of what they are ready to roll-out this Fall below. Notice the links to UMW Blogs courses, YouTube, Twitter, blog posts, Flickr, etc.  What's nice about this is that it's all being automatically aggregated together based on an individual user's profile page. It is a self-service approach that gives each user control over what social media they want to share, if any.  What's more, Cathy and Curtiss are also working on aggregated discipline- specific pages that will feature the work happening across various courses in a discipline on UMW Blogs (or whatever platform they use),Facebook, Twitter, etc. What's powerful here is that we can actually create a series of aggregated landing pages for departments automatically and then re-syndicate that into an uber-aggregation piece of the work happening across all the disciplines at UMW ? how would that be for a university homepage?!  I think this is truly groundbreaking stuff for a university website, why no one is talking about it has to be they just don't fully understand how awesome it is. We've been proto-typing distributed authorship across campus with the Faculty-Staff Newsletter site Eagle Eye and it has worked brilliantly ? 1857 posts in just about two years and a 125 different authors.  Another thing is that we couldn't be doing this at a better time because we have started a Domain of One's Own pilot wherein anywhere from 300-400 faculty and students will have their own domains and web hosting. We will finally be doing what George Siemens, via Brian Lamb, suggested universities do:  > ƒschools should be in the business of managing data flows rather than in supporting an end to end user experience. We can only dream what might result if the energy going into the campus-wide LMS's would go into creating flexible and easy to use ""syndication buses"" or to addressing pragmatic instructor challenges to using the ""small pieces"" approach  ?  things like student management tools, gradebooks etc. And what about providing the service of institutional archiving and data backups to mitigate the risks of using third party tools?  That remains a montra for us here at UMW, and we are getting closer and closer!  "Jim Groom,"Refocusing and Refueling: Keene, Caulfield, and Udell",http://bavatuesdays.com/refocusing-and-refueling-keene-caulfield-and-udell/,7/24/2012,"Downtown Keene, NH  Image credit: Dougton's ""Keene, New Hampshire""  Almost a month ago I spent four days up in Keene, New Hampshire thanks to a generous offer to present at the New Hampshire state college system's Academic Technology Institute (can anyone point me to the official conference website?). I presented a version of a talk that has been evolving for the last year (ever since Maricopa), and you can see my slides for this one here. The talk was received by a very kind and engaged room of faculty and instructional technologists who were there to think about how they can integrate new media into their courses. But I would be lying if I didn't acknowledge that the presentation was only part of the reason I was there. The other driving motivation for me to get to Keene, NH was to have some quality conversational time with Jon Udell and Mike Caulfield. And that I did, not to mention I killed quite a few zombies along the way ??  Jon and Mike may be two of the most simultaneously precise and abstract thinkers in educational technology I've met, although Jon might rightfully resist that categorization given his reach is far larger than just education. What's so powerful about these two is that they both operate from a vast technical understanding that is filtered through a deeply abstract knowledge of the philosophical ideas that underpin the web as virtual phenomenon we're still trying to get our collective heads around. More than 6 years ago Jon came to UMW as the keynote speaker at Faculty Academy in 2006 to talk about 21st Literacy Century, and since then he's been somewhat of a guiding light for our work. His ideas of aggregation, web thinking, the professional uses of blogging, a domain of one's own, and archiving have driven much of the spirit of our work at UMW since. In just about every project we have done there is a deep debt of conceptual thinking to Udell. He's kinda like the patron saint of DTLT ?? My own intellectual lineage of ds106, A Personal Cyberinfrastructure, a Domain of One's Own, etc., can be traced back to a recommendation by Gardner to listen to a podcast by Jon that I blogged about back in 2008 (while I was at University of Richmond no less) that was titled ""Imagining Cyberinfrastructure.""  So being able to talk to him at length about A Domain of One's Own, UMW Blogs, the future of UMW's website, and more general plans for syndication, aggregation, and archiving UMW's work was an absolute treat. We actually spent 9 innings of a Keene Swamp Bats baseball game talking about all of this, and I couldn't have imagined a better backdrop for two red-blooded Americans ?? One of the issues we talked about extensively is the ability for individuals to manage their own data across a wide variety of social spaces that enables them to truly control their contexts and build a sense of who they are, what's more it begins to disrupt the idea of content as currency for profit-driven systems that only understand you as a commodity, ideas very much in line with Brian Lamb's recent post about the limits of content. A topic which reminds me of deep problems Jon had back in 2006 at Faculty Academy with technologists referring to people as users.  Talking at length with Udell was inspiring because so much of these questions also start to lead back to personal archiving, some basic ideas of how the web works, and a sense of ownership and participation in the process ? in many ways the time just further reinforced just how important and vital the work so many of us are doing on the margins of the corporate parades of massive online learning. Bringing it back to the individual, because as Gardner Campbell has said again and again ? and his thinking and metaphors and connecting is absolutely integral to all this ? the individual scales on the web, it's the only thing that can! So talking at length with Jon has re-inspired my work here at UMW ? he really charged me up to take the Domain of One's Own pilot by storm. I think some localized experimentation is the best tonic for the hype and mechanization that everywhere surrounds us.  Mike and I ate pizza here  Image credit: Dougton's ""Keene, New Hampshire""  But that's only the half of it because when I return from baseball with Jon (not unlike Fishing with Jon), I come face-to-face with madman Mike Caulfield. If he's not killing zombies he is talking about the deep problems with our approach to online learning more generally. One of the things Mike and I have in common is that we both do basically the same thing at very similar schools. Keene State is a public, liberal arts college like UMW. Keene State has 5000 students like UMW. Keene State is trying to understand where it fits in the online learning world like UMW. So Mike and I have a lot to talk about on these accounts, and from the moment he picked me up at the airport until the moment I left that's most of what we did, save killing some zombies. One of the many things I picked up from Mike along the way was the refocusing of the online education away from ""the end of the liberal arts, campus-based experience"" rhetoric and towards the idea of how online learning at schools like UMW and Keene can actually reinforce what the campus-based, liberal arts experience. Mike sys it brilliantly here:  > When it comes to online education boosterism, I'm pretty hardcore. You can do a ton with online as well as (or better) than you can face-to-face. But I can't imagine anything like my undergrad experience online, anything as powerful as it without the residential element. The big face-to-face experience that online has trouble replacing isn't the absence of the physical teacher, it's the face-to-face experience of students meeting other students and re-envisioning who they are in the process.  This idea of congregating in space as part of the experience is crucial, and often overlooked because it is somewhat intangible, it is the interstitial experiences that are often the most powerful part of the process. Mike understands this intuitively, he is subtle in his critique, and exacting with his facts and details ? he's the best friend you could have if you want someone to really challenge you on your thinking. What's more, he is an invaluable asset for Keene State as they start to negotiate the reality of online learning as part and parcel of the future of public liberal arts colleges like ours. And every school needs someone who will call them on all the bullshit associated with online learning right now, it is essential!  Another deep affinity I have with Mike is that over the last two years or so we've both been experimenting wildly in the classroom. In parallel with the work we've done at UMW with ds106, Mike has been building an awesome course around Statistics and Quantitative Reasoning on a site call ""Making Fair Comparisons"" that is doubling as an open textbook that he will be feeding his future classes through. It's a brilliant project designed in WordPress, and he's working on how to integrate infographics, daily creates, assignments, etc. into the mix. This is the stuff that we should be talking about, this is someone pouring their heart into a process of teaching that isn't offloading it to the next vendor driven system, it's a process is made up of his blood, sweat, and tears. It's a way he can help students at Keene State and beyond think creatively and critically about the information they are being fed. It is a life's mission to educate that is open and free to all, where has that sentiment gone lately in all the hoopla around massive? Seems like we ware exchanging the open and free for the massive and profitable.  I can't thank Mike and Jon nealy enough for helping me refocus and refuel during my four days in Keene, NH. It's a little-known New England mecca for creative thinking about the future of the web and education, and I'm honored to have experienced even a little of it. I feel safer knowing you are both doing what you are doing ? keep on rocking in a free state ??  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own as Legacy Archival Project,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-as-legacy-archival-project/,7/26/2012,"Image credit dolescum's Archives' stacks  In the seven years I have been at UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies we've done a fair bit of experimentation. Most of that has been centered around commodity web hosting, domains, and one-click install open source applications. That method has paid off for us beautifully, so much so that the experimentation we did early on resulted in a successful blogging platform, a cutting-edge university website run on WordPress, and even an extensible framework for a course like ds106. Our experimentation has resulted in grassroots projects that have become official platforms that the campus interfaces with on a daily basis. None of this happened because it was forced on people, but rather because people found the various services we provided useful. This, for me, is the ultimate sign of success for an outfit like ours.  The other, uglier side of the early experimentation is that it can be messy. Early on there was the exciting and chaotic proliferation of sites, domains, and web hosting accounts as we were exploring. That momentum slowly began to shift as we built more scalable models like UMW Blogs and umw.edu on WordPress. Turns out folks around campus were more than willing to stop using their externally hosted sites and return to the fold once they had an easy, powerful publishing platform like WordPress to work with.  So for the last week or two Tim Owens, Andy Rush, and I have been trying to clean up the vestiges of the web hosting and domain diaspora that has been languishing for several years now. The Domain of One's Own pilot provided us a perfect occasion to transfer all the various domains and web hosting files from the disparate accounts to our own dedicated server for the project so that we can consolidate and manage all these files. What's more, we can give any individual and/or department their own web hosting access because that is what this pilot is all about. After we consolidate all the web hosting accounts and domains to the Domain of One's Own server we'll have saved the university anywhere from $1000-$2000 per year in ongoing domain and hosting costs which means the cost of the pilot is closer to $8000 or $9000 this year ? now that's an innovative bargain!  What's interesting is that the diaspora of sites has slowly consolidated to the point where we can both manage and archive all of the legacy work we have done over the last seven years while getting rid of the chafe and making sure the sites don't become overgrown with web kipple, or even worse just disappear. It feels really good to be working through this process this Summer to make sure the work students and faculty have done on a wide range of sites over a long period of time is archived, consolidated, and available for the foreseeable future. I may even get the pre-cursor to UMW blogs, ELS Blogs, back up and running over the next week or two ? which would be awesome, not to mention it would fix a lot of broken links from a large number of bava posts from 2007.  "Jim Groom,Got My Head in the Cloud: Udell on Domain of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/got-my-head-in-the-cloud-udell-on-domain-of-ones-own/,7/29/2012,"Jon Udell blogged about the history of an experiment that is finally taking root here at UMW. The pilot is the dry run for giving every Freshman their own domain and web hosting space by Fall 2013 in order to embrace and encourage students to becomes master's of their own spaces, and get in the habit of maintaining their own personal archive of work. It will be built into the curriculum of a number of courses, and it's a model of that ask students to take responsibility of their digital presence. To manage their online identities and build it so that they can take it with them when they go. Also, it pushes courses to acknowledge and embrace the open web as an integral part of the of the process of teaching and learning in a classroom or online.  What this means is that universities have to start thinking more like the web, but not in the catastrophic terms of MOOCs and the end of institutions, but rather in terms of understanding how networks and networked culture can change our understanding of sharing, transparency, privacy, and building collaborative infrastructure (Jon Udell's talk back in 2009, The Disruptive Nature of Technology, is a brilliant framework to oeprate from here if you're looking for more). How can IT organizations like UMW's DoIT, head up by CIO Justin Webb be on board with something like Domain of One's Own? I don't know, but UMW's IT organization is! This is not a radical, subversive pilot behind IT's back, this is a pilot the CIO not only sees promise in, but also funded it outright. DTLT and the Department of Information Technologies are partners in pretty powerful ways ? that is an amazing thing to be writing on this blog! It's actually a great day in that regard. So major kudos to Justin Webb.  What's more, Tim Owens came to UMW little over a year ago and rebooted the whole pilot (talk about a shot of adrenaline!), got the server up an running, learned how to be a sysadmin for 300-400 people, groked the tech immediately and made it transparent for every one. This is one guy? And moving into this semester ? nevermind him blogging on the Makerbot blog about UMW's Maker Space ? he's got the Domain of One's Own project well in hand. We are working on documentation and a introductory video as we speak.  I got my head in the clouds right now, Domain of One's Own is more than a dream and Jon Udell is blogging about it! That's a good omen, and one that I hope frames the long and distributed life of an idea that UMW's current perfect storm has been able to make official and legit. This is very good.  What's more, do a quick google search for Domain of One's Own (no quotes). We also are the top 5 out of 47 million possible hits. Google juice.  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own as Educational Pilot of Federated Web,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-as-educational-pilot-of-federated-web/,8/4/2012,"Special thanks to George Kroner for pointing me to the article ""The Federated Web Should Be Easier Than It Sounds"" which nicely frames some of the larger implications of taking control of your own domain:  > If you had your own domain name and kept good backups you could move from host to host and even to entirely different blogging systems (though you might mess up your permalinks). E-mail can work the same way, if you use your own domain name instead of your host's. These are what some people call ""federated systems.""  >  > I'm interested in plans to build federated versions of the internet, including ""darknets"" like Freenet, Crptosphere or wireless internet alternatives like Project Meshnet and the many many other project like it. But for those of us living in relatively free countries, just having an internet where everyone owns their own portable identity is good enough. Owning a domain name is a bit on the geeky side, but it's not like asking people to learn to program or configure their own Linux servers. We can still rely on hosted services ? as long as we can pack up and move out of them when the time comes.  This framework is important for me because part of thinking through a Domain of One's Own at UMW has to be about architectures of empowerment for students and faculty alike. A long-view of our increasingly mediated realities that allows us to enable individual control over our digital artifacts. What is awesome about this project is it is at once architectural, technical, philosophical, and liberatory. I'm increasingly of the mindset that what's happening at UMW with a Domain of One's Own (all work born out of UMW Blogs and ds106) is yet another powerful and forward-thinking approach to federating the web and empowering our students and faculty who use it ? which is all of them!  "Jim Groom,From the Archive: ELS Blogs,http://bavatuesdays.com/from-the-archive-els-blogs/,8/12/2012,"This time 5 years ago we were closing down ELS Blogs, UMW's first multi-user WordPress experiment (well actually the second if you count Lyceum), to make way for the campus-wide blogging platform that would be known as UMW Blogs. Five years ago at UMW's DTLT were heady times, there was still a lot of promise and possibility around the ideas of open publishing through open source applications ? much of which has dissipated lately. The ability to deliver an open source publishing platform for an entire campus in-house with no coding experience and even less time is a little heralded marvel of the open web.  ELS Blogs had a bunch of amazing blogs on it, with the majority of them being students of Gardner Campbell, whose vision was the reason behind the platform. In fact, part of the push to get ELS Blogs back online came after I recieved an email from one of his students asking about her blog:  > I graduated from UMW in 2008. I had a blog through this site for a film class back in 2007 and for years have not been able to login to it but I have been able to view it. Recently I was searching for it, to possibly have one of my posts published, and I can't seem to find it anywhereƒ.  >  > The name of my article was Fast, Cheap and in Control?  >  > Please let me know if there is anyway to recover this! I really hope to get the piece published. Thank you very much!  What was lost is now found! This isn't the first email I've gotten like this, in fact I get many like it, but usually it is to export their work. This was a rare occasion in that the post was, indeed, offline. The issue was that ELS Blogs was offline for a year and a half (since December 2010) because of deeply annoying Bluehost issues ? they started limiting the number and size of database tables threatening to suspend your account if you went over. (As an aside, I am very glad to note DTLT will very shortly be free of supporting any and all Bluehost accounts for departments.) We pride ourselves with archiving everything, and even back in 2007 we pushed students to take ownership of their work ? but it's only now that we can transform that ethos until a full blown pilot project in the form of A Domain of One's Own.  Fact is, the Domain of One's Own project has allowed us to archive so much of the work we've done in DTLT since 2004-2005. We're moving all of the domains and webhosting accounts we had strewn all over campus to our own MediaTemple server and reclaiming and cleaning up a ton of work ? and saving some money as well. All the while we're archiving old, one-off WordPress blogs to UMW Blogs and mapping the domains where appropriate (but more on this process in another post). In many ways A Domain of One's Own is born out of an extremely fertile seven year period of experimentation that has gradually become more centralized and scalable. The Domain of One's Own pilot helps us manage that reality while at the same time opening up an entirely new period of experimentation at UMW. I feel like UMW is moving from one moment of experimentation to another, and it is doing it cleanly with an archive to show for it.  Finally, let me add that none of this could have been possible without Tim Owens' undying dedication and genius to making the conception that was A Domain of One's Own into a hard and fast reality. He has been a godsend for DTLT specifically, and UMW more generally. Tim is nothing short of amazing, I challenge you to show me one better!  "Jim Groom,The State of Aggregation at UMW,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-state-of-aggregation-at-umw/,8/21/2012,"I'm usually not a whiteboard image blogger, but we've been going through some structural work at UMW with various projects and we are having to map things out more and more. One of the things we've been working on with Cathy Derecki and Curtiss Grymala is the idea of how we start aggregating course work for classes and resource sites back to departmental sites on umw.edu. Or, bring them into planet like sites that capture course work out in the open. Not only will this come from UMW Blogs, but it will also come from students and faculty using the Domain of One's Own project, which means a large number will be self-hosted blogs. And we'll depend a lot more on the Syndication of Syndication approach, which is exciting because thanks to Martha Burtis, the sign-up of Domain of One's Own will automatically capture domain information spreadsheet and we can start figuring out how to discover feeds and tag filters. At the same time, Martha has also figured out how to pass the blog URL to FeedWordpress for sites like ds106 and associate it with the right user, which means the syndication process around UMW Blogs might become even more seamless. This is real headway!  The whiteboard image above captures how we are thinking through tagging course blog aggregators like feedwordpress so each syndicated posts has a distinct department, course #, section, year, and faculty name. How can we start using these bit of already collected and formatted data to start filtering course/department posts back into aggregator spaces on the UMW website more broadly. What would it mean to go to a umw.edu site and see the work happening in classrooms around campus virtually? Courses, students and faculty can figure out their own featuring mechanisms, we just aggregate and republish them around the umw site. But how and where, well Cathy and Curtiss have kind of answered that with the design for the aggregation hubs for individual faculty and discipline specific sites:  How do we start aggregating all of these various blogs into a series of nodes that are discoverable whether they be individual (as seen above), course, discipline and/or departmental (as seen below).  I wonder if the future of aggregation might not be imagined on an institutional level like we are trying to do at UMW right now, this could allow for the ideas of empowering folks to manage and maintain their own data. An experiment in both studying and applying the ways the future is changing some elements of what constitutes a literate society. Understanding aggregation and syndication as realities and metaphors as a kind of literacy?  "Jim Groom,A Round-Up of Fall 2012 Projects at DTLT,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-round-up-of-fall-2012-projects-at-dtlt/,8/21/2012,"The Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) at UMW is a high- functioning, self-motivated group. We all know our roles, and we perform them with precision regularly. A well-oiled machine, if you will. We haven't had a staff meeting in a few months, so today (the Monday before classes) we sat down to take stock of our current projects as the semester gets going. And the annotated picture below is a breakdown of the projects we came up with, all of which, mind you, are actually happening now:  A Whiteboard of DTLT Projects Fall 2012  After the meeting, which was just a little over an hour, Andy Rush snapped a shot of the whiteboard which I figured I'd annotate and breakdown as an exercise in documenting what we're working on as of Fall 2012. What's more, it might be interesting to revisit this post at the end of the semester to see how everything played out, but I guess we'll see about that.  1) Bluehost Migration  I blogged about how we've spent a lot of time this Summer archiving the work we've done over the past seven years with open source applications like WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, etc. We moved the various web hosting accounts, applications, and pointed the domains to a server we're running through Media Temple. Thanks to the Herculean efforts by Tim Owens and Andy Rush this process is all but done. We have a few random Bluehost accounts left, but archiving all the work we've done with faculty, students and staff over the years is a major accomplishment and one I'm thrilled to almost have behind us. I'm hoping byby end of September would be nothing short of awesome.  2) Domain of One's Own  Where to begin? The A. B. and C. in that annotation points to the documentation, template email, and general support for the participating faculty, who are are listed to the right. Also, thanks to Martha Burtis, signing-up for Domain of One's Own will automatically capture a person's domain information in a spreadsheet and we can start figuring out how to discover feeds and tag filters. Everyone involved will be experimenting with framing the way students might consider web hosting, choosing a domain, and taking control of the space through which they teach and learn. I was thrilled when Jon Udell blogged about it here, and think this might be an amazing moment for a sense of participating and architecting the web as part of your framework for thinking about university and learning. It's a big one, and it is happening!!!  3) Maker  This is a rare and very rad space that Tim Owens, George Meadows, and Rosemary Arneson put together this Summer, and it promises to be a highlight for faculty and students alike. It currently has 2 makerbots, a printerbot, and their have been grumblings of more (an art student got a grant for one!), Arduino, Dremel, tools, tables, and more. It's a workshop for creativity. This room is really compelling, like the 3D Printing, because it engages a sense of STEM education that is applied and engaging. This has only become to emerge as a hub on campus, and what's more it lives in the library, bringing us closer and closer in our relationship to the library, which has been nice. Our missions are aligning quite well.  4) Online Learning Initiative (OLI)  Steve Greenlaw, Martha Burtis, and I are getting ready for our second cohort of online learning fellows that will be thinking about what it might mean to think through a course for the online environment. We'll have a series of meetings over the course of the Fall wherein we will be talking about the virtual environment, how values transfer to and from the classroom, and what it might mean to design a course for and on the web. This may be one of the most engaging spacing right now, and the assessments from the faculty who have experimented in cohort 1 are fascinating ? there is a lot to be excited about. More on that shortly though. What's also exciting is that out new teaching center director, Mary Kayler (where's your blog Mary?), will also be part of this initiative.  5) Distance & Blended Learning Committee  Well, this isn't really a project but a committee. It actually doesn't really belong on the projects list just yet, but the overlap with some of the ideas in the OLI are a natural osmosis.  6) President  This is kinda of a nice meta-list within the list. A list of what we will share with UMW's President Hurley as potential digital initiatives that the university might start promoting and closely associating themselves with. The idea of marrying the digital to the liberal arts, campus-based experience seems like a natural and organic academic and intellectual development for our culture. It's important, and we have a number of initiatives that would begin to frame out a curriculum and philosophy around the work we do at UMW. The list, featuring a number of ideas that I already listed above so omitted below, has a few new ideas/projects that move beyond DTLT, but still are at the center of our mission.     Digital Studies Initiative (DSI): This has already gotten some traction, and anywhere from 110-20 faculty have been meeting independently to talk about the possibility of building a minor around Digital Studies, and this has gotten recognized by the administration and is now pretty much in process. Special kudos to Jeff McClurken for putting this all together, and making a real push to see it all materialize. This could be a focus of how UMW starts rethinking the curriculum for the 21st century skills in learning.     Digital Knowledge Center (DKC): Related to the Digital Studies Initiative is the space that start to emerge in the library wherein we start to work directly with students to imagine what this means for archiving, searching, and managing the trace of their scholarship moving forward. A focused, student support network for this stuff that lives in the library would make total sense. What""s interesting is that it was part of a QEP martha Burtis and Jeff McClurken worked on over a year ago. And this could be developed out to bring the freshman, curricular experience as a digital phenomenon still might work coupled with a Domain of One's Own.    Digital Repository: A conversation on hold for almost 3 or 4 years now when the librarian working with Fedora went to VCU (Hi Tom!). This is an excellent opportunity to revisit how the library plays into the experience of a Domain of one;s own, thinking through archiving, controlling once work, and thinking through what others find when they search you, and how. A whole curriculum about the production of knowledge in the internet era.    The future of Faculty Academy? Sad, but true, we may have to rethink Faculty Academy as a year-round event. The jury is out on this, but it is worth throwing out there because a little experimentation along those lines might be of value.  All of these above listed ideas will be sent to the President as a recommendation for possible futures for UMW and digital media.   7) SCHEV Open Conference  UMW will be hosting a Digital Learning Resources conference for state insitutions. A committee run through SCHEV has formed and we will be putting on a conference to showcase the best teaching and learning with technology work happening around the state. The RFP is being reviewed and will be discussed in more detail shortly (it is modelled closely on Open Education call). UMW has gotten permission to host it, and we are working on getting this thing going by Spring Break 2013! I have a lot to do on this very soon, but I am excited about bringing constituents from all the state colleges and universities to have a discussion about how we can share resources.  8) QEP  Martha is running this, a fact I detailed in this post on her awesomeness, and it's a nice, iterative approach to building a publishing platform, maybe like UBC's Resource Management Framework, that we can pilot in Spring and have developers work on and customize or integrate with WordPress over the Summer. So much better than spending $10K on learning modules ? waste of money. Build a platform that enables people to publish easy, as well as making it easy to reuse, remix, and share information on a domain of knowledge.  9) Canvas  We are heading into year two of Canvas. No issues, we're sailing along. Don't ask me what's going on in there cause I don't know! ?? More seriously, we might be able to integrate kaltura into Canvas if it is as easy as it has been for UMW Blogs (more on that nowƒ)  10) Media Server/Kaltura  We now have a Media Servera, and it is running the open source version of Kaltura. The all-in-one plugin allows you to integrate Kaltura accounts with a WordPress blog, and hence upload and embed videos through the WordPress interface without them ever touching UMW Blogs servers. Beautiful! If this is as easy for Canvas as it was WordPress we should be golden.  Bonus  After reading Luke Waltzer's review and rationale for having Blogs @ Baruch moved to Active Directory I can see why we might want to do that on UMW Blogs, especially given Boone has already written the plugins. I might tackle this sometime mid-semester and set it loose over Winter. CUNY for the win, again!  OK, I guess that is all we have in terms of projects, now we have to go and support the faculty because their classes are starting next week. It's showtime!  "Jim Groom,Designing a Hardboiled Course Site,http://bavatuesdays.com/designing-a-hardboiled-course-site/,8/26/2012,"Designing the Hardboiled lit course site over the last couple of weeks has been fun. I'm modeling it very much on the way I built the early ds106 course sites in the Spring and Fall of 2010. I love TwentyTen because it is the closest thing to K2 on the market, and I remain old school. Tim Owens cracks smart about my devotion to this theme, but he's a philistine. Twentyten4life!  Anyway, so I am using the TwentyTen theme and the course site is an aggregation hub of all the students work that will be syndicated in from their own blogs. This course will be one of the 10 or 11 courses this semester piloting the Domain of One's Own project at UMW. What's nice about this is I can actually approach the beginning of the course as a discussion about their digital identity, the experimentation UMW is doing to encourage them to think about the digital space and their learning, as well as having them think about how they might become sysadmins of their education. What's nice, too, is that this is a literature course, so it will push us to think about how we can use digital media to think and talk about literature ? for many the divorce between the two is all too academic, I want to disrupt that. It was easy for people to dismiss what we did with ds106 because that's ""digital storytelling,"" now it is time to show the people what can be done with a lit class and a few good animated GIFs ??  Part of what is fun about the Domain of One's Own is each class can have its own domain. I took advantage of that and purchased murderinc.biz as the course domain. I've never had a biz domain, and I figured it was high time. The actual course blog is run through UWM Blogs, I am just mapping blog.murderinc.biz onto it. I am also experimenting with Tumblr this semester, and I am mapping the domain tumblr.murderinc.biz on that site as well. I'll have the students experiment similarly, demonstrating their options for creating their own blog, mapping on top of an existing service, or some combination of the two. I am working on documentation for this process currently here.  The syllabus and course calendar were created in the UMW Blogs wiki and are being pulled seamlessly into the blog pages using the outdated, but still awesome Wiki Inc plugin ? we'll be upgrading sometime this semester to Wiki Embed thanks to the awesome folks at UBC! Finally, I am going to work with martha on Monday if possible to see if we can;t use Gravity Forms on UMW Blogs to automate the way the course site creates users on UMW Blogs and automatically pulls their feeds into FeedWordPress, associates them with the correct author automatically, and tags every post with the hardboiled tag. Martha has figured out how to automate FeedWordPress using Gravity Forms, and it's awesome. She's already got it working on #ds106 and David Wiley's EdStartUp 101 site, which means this is an approach we might see more an more of for other courses that want to using a syndication/hub model. What's even cooler is we should be able to roll-out a more streamlined approach for the aggregator/hub approach using FeedWordPress on UMW Blogs just in time to support the Domain of One's Own push to have students manage their own work and syndicate it appropriately.  The course will alos be doing assignments around design and visual elements of the noir, writing experiments, and a Wikipedia research component I want to build into this site using Wiki Embed. I think I'll be developing out the site as the course evolves, it is my first time teaching it at UMW as a Freshman seminar ? and I've found being as loose and flexible as you possibly can with the design of a new class the better. I'm sure it will change, I just hope for the better. Also, I am still getting my head around how I'll be using Tumblr. I am thinking every week their will be a visual/design challenge, and we will feature those on Tumblr but aggregate them into their blog, or vice versa. We'll see, ideas are always appreciated.  "Jim Groom,Documenting a Domain of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/documenting-a-domain-of-ones-own/,8/28/2012,"Over the last month or so we've been piecing together the Domain of One's Own pilot, and it really is a thing of beauty. I already talked about how we're using it to archive a ton of work we've done over the past seven years, as well as how it represents an architecture of empowerment for faculty and students alike. In this post I want to talk a bit about how we're running and supporting this pilot to give folks a sense of the practical day-to-day of getting something like this off the ground.  First off, We're running both the commodity web hosting and domains through Media Temple. More than seven years ago in UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) we started a similar pilot that gave all the instructional technology staff their own domain and web hosting through Bluehost in order to experiment with what's possible. Seven years later we're doing that same experiment with at least 400 faculty and staff, but this time DTLT is acting like Bluehost. We're managing the signup for the hosting and domains for all pilot members, and we're taking the lead on supporting it around campus.  The Sign-Up Process   Streamlining the process through which faculty and students get domains and web hosting is part of what we're trying to perfect over the course of this year's pilot. As of now participants are asked to sign-up through a form designed by Martha Burtis that automatically checks if the domain they want is available and runs them through the web hosting signup.  The sign-up form is slick because it helps us reduce the possibilities of typos when it comes to domain sign-ups as well automatically associating sign- ups with specific classes so that we can start to play with syndicating and aggregating the work from around the pilot (more on that as it develops!).  The web hosting sign-up is automated so that once they click the ""Buy Now"" button (we are trying to get rid of the ""buy"" verbiage given this is all free for students and faculty) they're taken right to the forms on Media Temple and can have their account in minutes. The domain sign-up, however, is manual. As of now all the requested domains go to a spreadsheet that we regularly to submit as a ticket to Media Temple so that they can add the domains (we have an open account with a few thousand dollars set aside just for domains ? but with the current $4 domain sale this will go a long way ?? ) after they add the domain we (which is royal for Tim Owens ?? ) have to manually point the nameservers for each one. This is labor intensive but not impossible for 300-400 domains, but it will be impossible for the 1000-1500 roll-out for every Freshman next September if all goes well this year?which it will. Automating this process should not be too hard and Tim Owens, the mastermind behind the Domain of One's Own setup, has already been working on the details.  Supporting the Pilot   Supporting the pilot is pretty much a three-pronged approach of documentation, class visitis, and follow-up.  Documentation: Up front we try and document as much of the technical details for using the web hosting account as we can. This includes tutorials for creating a subdomain, installing applications like WordPress, using FIle Manager, setting up FTP, mapping a subdomain, etc. We're building this documentation in a MediaWiki install here and then using UBC's amazing WikiEmbed plugin to dynamically populate the entire wiki documentation site as pages in WordPress here. (As an aside, the WikiEmbed plugin developed by Enej at UBC is absolutely brilliant, and special thanks to Alan Levine for bringing this back to UMW so we could fully understand the brilliance behind such a publishing approach.)  Classroom visits: Another thing we'll be doing these next couple of weeks is visiting courses that are piloting the Domain of One's Own and talking to students about the vision, ethos, and practicalities of the project (save our ds106 sections which already have the Domain of One's Own project as part of their DNA). Documentation is a great backup, but nothing beats a sense of immediacy and presence in the classroom as this all starts moving along. In the beginning UMW Blogs was built on quick and quality support from DTLT, and classroom visits played a huge role in that early on.  Follow-up: Pretty simple, follow-up with faculty and students on a regular basis to make sure they aren't having issues. This includes reading and commenting on their blogs, contacting individuals throughout the semester, and setting up workshops for faculty and students to build portfolio sites, image sites, map domains, etc. Finding ways to creatively follow-up with this semester's pilot cohort as a means to encourage faculty and students to experiment with the tools they now have is crucial, and I would love more recommendations in this area.  And that's where we're at so far with the Domain of One's Own pilot. It's really happening, which I still can't believe! What's more, it's quite manageable thus far, and I think as we understand the process and issues over the next few months we should have no problem streamlining the sign-up process and campus-wide support to go campus-wide by Fall 2013.  "Jim Groom,The Roach Motel,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-roach-motel/,8/30/2012,"I had the distinct pleasure today to give an impromptu and rather impassioned presentation to Jess Rigelhaupt's Freshman Seminar about their participation in the Domain of One's Own project. My tact for this presentation was to start by talking about Facebook and how it was similar to a Roach Motel. But, as is often the case with my 70s and 80s popular culture allusions, none of the students really knew the reference. So, in order to counteract their pop culture ignorance I quickly jumped on the internet and brought up the 1978 commercial featuring the classic ""Roaches check in, but they don't check out"" tagline. I often use this quote to frame the way Facebook, and other third party services, make it next to impossible to truly control your own data. I understand it isn't a perfect analogy, but I just love calling Facebook a Roach Motel to a room full of students who live there ?? A Domain of One's Own is on like Donkey Kong!  "Jim Groom,"Week 1: Hardboiled Domains, #6wordstory, and Hemingway",http://bavatuesdays.com/hardboiled-domains-6wordstory-and-hemingway/,8/31/2012,"Last night was the second night of the Hardboiled: US Detective Fiction course and we covered a few things ranging from A Domain of One's Own pilot project to writing a #6wordstory on Twitter as a way to introduce the semester's first author: Ernest Hemingway.  Paul Ward's contribution to the hardboiled animated GIF love is legendary with Lee Marvin from the 1964 version of The Killers  It was nice to see that by the second class all but two of the hardboiled students had their domains up and running. The Domain of One's Own pilot is proving remarkably seamless thus far, and for anyone who says it's far too great a technical expectation of our faculty and students I would simply reply that everyone else's expectations are far too low. UMW students and faculty are managing this pilot beautifully. What's more, we have the support system in place to help them figure it out should there be any difficulties ? which there will be ? because we are, after all, a learning institution and this is part of what we should be supporting. Period.  After an overview of the web host options, I gave them a crash course for creating subdomains, installing WordPress, and managing their personal blog site. Once again there were no issues here, and students seemed absolutely unfazed by what I was asking of them. If we can acculturate anywhere from 100-200 freshman to become the sysadmins of their own educational platform from day one of their college careers then anything is possible ? and this time next year it will be anywhere from 900-1000 freshman.  As a transition from the technical elements of getting their own sites up and running we moved to talking about Hemingway. I make no pretense that Hemingway belongs to the detective fiction genre per se, in fact Dashiell Hammett (along with various pulp writers for Black Mask) in the early 20s can claim far more influence over the 20th century incarnation of the genre in the U.S. Nonetheless, I do contend that Hemingway's style and theories about writing play an important role in shaping the stylistic approach of detective fiction. What's more, Hemingway's short story collection In Our Time (1925) helps frame the larger cultural, historical context for a ""Lost Generation""  ?  a literary frame for understanding a generation that experienced the mechanized and fragmented horrors of warfare during World War I. Themes that would remain relevant up and until the Great Depression, but also remain a referent point throughout World War II. In effect, Hemingway gets us talking about these concepts and themes while Dashell Hammett's Red Harvest introduces the class to the emergence of gangster culture viz-a-viz Prohibition, and John Fante's Ask the Dust frames the Great Depression through the lens of Los Angeles: America's emerging epicenter of culture and depravity (a theme that will dominate much of the fiction we read thereafter).  Anyway, before I got into all of that, I spent a moment looking at the #6wordstory meme that Mike Wesch turned me on to when I was in Kansas this past February. According to snopes.com, this meme attributes the following six-word story to Hemingway: ""Baby shoes. Never worn. For sale."" While apocryphal, this example is a compelling way to think about minimalism as a style to communicate as much as possible in as few words possible. The first assignment for the hardboiled students, in addition to reading half of In Our Time, is to start a Twitter account and tweet out a six-word story. A couple of them have already done this, and it's a fun way to make first contact, and also realize there's already a rich #sixwordstory community on Twitter.  Hemingway photographed in Milan, 1918, dressed in uniform. For two months he drove ambulances until he was wounded.  Finally, I discussed a bit of Hemingway's early biography. I'm fascinated by how young Hemingway was when he entered the world, so to speak. In 1917, when Hemingway finished high school and was exactly the same age of many of the students in the room, he wasn't heading to college, rather he immediately entered the professional world of journalism and soon after shipped off for the Great War in Europe. At the age of 18 he was severely wounded while serving in Italy as a member of the Red Cross. Despite his severe wounds, he managed to carry another wounded Italian soldier to safety which earned him the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Did I mention he was still just 18? By his mid-20s he had already become part of possibly the greatest international literary scene of the 20th century in Paris and would soon after publish three of his most important works: In Our Time, The Sun Also Rises (1926), and A Farewell to Arms (1929). Say what you will about Hemingway, his first 30 years were pretty impressive!  "Jim Groom,Hardboiled Blogging and the Art of Communicating,http://bavatuesdays.com/hardboiled-blogging-and-the-art-of-communicating/,9/26/2012,"Last night I spent the first twenty minutes of class talking about the art of blogging to the Hardboiled class (you can hear it here). I'm not much for forumlas or pre-fabricated approaches to anything, I think blogging is something students have to struggle with and come to terms with as we go for themselves. My job is to get them excited about the possibilities and encourage them to experiment with it, while at the same time making it part of who they are. Blogging is not writing papers, blogging is a creative form of self expression that encourages ""I"" but also demands them to articulate an opinion by way of a grounded argument. In this class it means focusing on the texts and starting to ground their positons in the words on the page. This is something we've been working at the last three or four weeks, and over the next three or four weeks we'll be integrating the elements of research into this equation viz-a-viz the Wikipedia projects we're spinning up now ? the first being to bring the Wikipedia article for the Hammett novel The Glass Key up to snuff.  What I noticed this week was just how much the students started to make the blogging their own. And to be honest I don't think it has much to do with this email I sent out, rather it's inspired by Paul Bond who has been modeling awesome blogging by thinking creatively and intelligently about the books we are reading and films we are watching. A class can be as massive as one amazing open, online participant! Paul has been animated GIFing, playing with t-shirts, using audio and visuals in all his posts, and regularly keeping up and making sense of this stuff, even more so than me ? I've fallen behind. What's more, this is starting to show up in students blog posts throughoput the class. What's amazing is they are using the media to make their arguments more powerfully. For example, Connor Payne used a series of 3 animated GIFs he found online from Miller's Crossing to draw the connections between that film and Hammett's Red Harvest.  Amazing! And while at first I thought this was an isolated incident, I soon realized it is anything but. Look at the way Jesse Lynch is using meme- inspired images and animated GIFs to make his argument that much more emphatic in this post, just brilliant! More and more the ideas of using visual images and animated GIFs to help make an argument are seeping their way into this class. What's interesting is just how much the web is part of the vernacular undergirding our discussions (and I would imagine most discussions happening in higher ed classrooms around the world). More and more I'll be encouraging and looking for creative ways to use images, animated GIFs, audio, video, etc., as part of a way to augment the reading experience and enrich the discussion. This is why ds106 should be a required course for every incoming UMW Freshman, and with the Domain of One's Own ready to go global next Fall, it's never too soon to start imagining a residential MOOC-like experience at UMW that includes 900-1000 students that all take ds106 as part and parcel of their first year experience.  "Jim Groom,"Open Architecture, a Vision Beyond the Massive Hype",http://bavatuesdays.com/open-architecture-a-vision-beyond-the-massive-hype/,10/1/2012,"Giulia Forsythe's ""The MOOC, the movie!""  When Instructure hired Jared Stein a year ago my faith in them multiplied exponentially. Jared is as smart a person as I've met working in this space, and he not only understands the field of edtech intimately, but he can also present his ideas creatively with the best of them. He's worked, taught, and generally lived the field for more than a decade and his deep understanding of the limits and possibilities of online learning spaces (hell, he coined the term creepy treehouse with Chris Lott) always makes his ideas of particular interest to me. What's more, the fact that he is spearheaded this space for discourse about ideas beyond the focused marketing speak of a single company suggests there are still a few companies out there who are willing to invest in good, thoughtful people like Jared.  So, when he asked me to inaugurate a new blogging project he's working on for Instructure I jumped at the chance. Not only am I honored to be kicking it off, but it gave me the opportunity to try and work through some of the ideas swirling around my head right now. The web has been abuzz with Massive Open Online Courses for the last five or six months, and the hoopla has pushed me to try and focus back in on the vision that I've always felt closest to. Namely, framing and designing an open experience that enables students and faculty to control the work they do online. And while I see this as very much at the heart of the work George Siemens, Stephen Downes, and Dave Comier have been doing with MOOCs since 2008, there can be little doubt the term got hijacked. As Lisa M. Lane noted in a comment on a recent Google+ discussion: ""I'm thinking we should go back to ïonline classes' and leave the term MOOC to the institutions that have co-opted it."" Believe me, I know the feeling of having your ideas co-opted, just not on this scale ?? So in response to Jared's request I turned my ideas into a post that in many ways tries to remain true to the spirit of the distributed, individualized ownership of ideas online while re-focusing the discussion to how we manage and distribute them not as massive courses, because the massive qualifier here commodifies the whole endeavor, but as a networked experience between and amongst courses, schools, institutions, and most importantly people. I'm not sure how successful I am at communicating any of this in the post, but for me the return to an open architecture wherein we can freely share and build on each other's work in innovative ways seems the best antidote to the all the hype. A Domain of One's Own #4life ??  So, if you made it this far without leaving you should really just go an read the post on Instructure's Keep Learning blog.  "Jim Groom,A Culture of Innovation,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-culture-of-innovation/,10/2/2012,"A Culture of Innovation from umwnewmedia on Vimeo.  UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) presented this afternoon at the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative's Online Fall Focus Session on the theme of innovation in higher education. The basic question guiding our presentation, which was centered around the 7 minute video above, was the following: how does a university like UMW consistently foster innovative projects like UMW Blogs, ds106, and, more recently, A Domain of One's Own?  There's no one adequate stock answer to such a question, so when preparing the presentation we decided to interview students, faculty, and staff around campus to get a broader sense of the culture of innovation happening at UMW. What we got in return for our labors was some really compelling stuff. The video was shot and edited by the great Andy Rush, and it's just a teaser for a much larger documentary that we are planning on making this semester to start chronicling and narrating the culture of innovation at UMW. It's really cool, and quite rewarding, to take the opportunity of a presentation like this and turn it into a project we can all get very excited about. We got your data, and just like Soylent Green, it's people!  "Jim Groom,EdStartUp meets the bava!,http://bavatuesdays.com/edstartup-meets-the-bava/,10/10/2012,"Earlier today I had the distinct pleasure of sitting down with David Wiley and Todd Manwaring as part of their EdStartUp 101 course. We talked for an hour in a Google Hangout broadcast live to YouTube about a wide range of things from the culture of innovation at the University of Mary Washington (at which point I recommended Andy Rush's awesome video) to the ridiculous push by certain state education systems' to outsource their expertise (at which point I invoked this article about CSU) to ds106 to the ds106 Kickstarter (at which point I read this quote from Faulkner) to UMW's latest pilot A Domain of One's Own (at which point David Wiley got me very excited about the idea again).  It was a far-ranging, but inspiring, conversation. David Wiley is a pro, pure and simple. He makes you feel comfortable, he listens, and he gets you excited about your own ideas. I've been feeling ambivalent about a number of things lately, not least of which the push to scale A Domain of One's Own for the entire entering Freshman class in 2013. Not afraid to challenge my wavering, David got me as excited about the idea as I've been all year ? in fact I think I needed to hear him talk about it to help me make some sense of it. If nothing else, this was an excellent presentation for me: conversational, free-ranging, and the right inspiration at the right time. It takes off at about minute 20, and the first 4 and half minutes are throw away so skip right to 4:30 for the intro, or just go right to minute 20 or 21 minutes in where the conversation starts to find its groove.  Thanks David and Todd, I really appreciate your giving me the time and space in your class to work through a wide range of ideas, issues, and concerns.  "Jim Groom,Tales from the Teaching Crypt: Education After Online,http://bavatuesdays.com/tales-from-the-teaching-crypt-education-after-online/,11/2/2012,"Image Credit: Grover Saunders made this Animated GIF during the presentation with Echograph (neat!)  Last week I had the distinct pleasure of attending James Madison University's 9th Annual Teaching and Learning with Technology conference (you can find the video here). JMU has quite an instructional technology group, and continues to prove just how robust Virginia's statewide expertise is in this realm. The EdTech group at JMU is doing some really impressive work across campus ? the conference schedule certainly points to this ?  and I'm hoping some of their awesome work makes its way to Virginia's Digital Learning Resources conference at UMW this coming March.  This presentation was one of my favorites in a long while, it was free wheeling as most are but it also focused more specifically on the questions of universities outsourcing their expertise, how to design for online education, and building a community online using animated GIFs ?? The theme of the presentation was the overstatement of the death of higher ed in the media currently and how we can start to shed some of the reactionary rhetoric and start returning teaching and learning innovation to the colleges and universities rather than corporations like Pearson. I cite Andy Rush's awesome A Culture of Innovation video, and also frame the Domain of One's Own project at UMW as a cultural evolution from UMW Blogs and ds106. I've intentionally been doing far fewer presentations that are much closer to home, and what has struck me as of late is that I have continually built upon an existing narrative of what UMW's DTLT has been working on for almost seven years now. And each new project and idea becomes another piece to a larger philosophy of open, accessible, and engaged education mediated through the web. It's been a real pleasure watching these various, and at times seemingly dislocated, ideas bloom into a full blown philosophy from which UMW's DTLT operates.  One correction in the talk: I state EC Comicsï Tales from the Crypt was published during the 50s and 60s which is wrong, it was published from 1950-1955. My bad.  Also, here are the slides with links:  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own has been funded!,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-has-been-funded/,11/8/2012,"Man, when I think about how much blogging I haven't yet done tonight that I need to, I begin to realize just how awesome a moment it is at UMW right now. Not only are we part of the visioning committee for a statewide conference for thinking how Virginia's educational resources might be shared more effectively, we are also working on developing an online learning initiative designed from values (which also has been been funded for next year); we're rocking the makerspace; we're making kickass videos about how awesome we are; we've had a hand in this little thing called ds106; and more generally we are swaggering like Mick Jaggerƒ.  But in addition to all that we got news earlier this week that the Domain of One's Own will be fully funded moving forward! This is huge for our group on a few counts: 1) it includes a half-time position that can help us get fully staffed again, 2) it illustrates the administration at UMW is fully committed to supporting the work we are doing (all the way up to president Hurley), and 3) we don't have to beg, steal and borrow to make Domain of One's Own happen. We've been so used to doing things on a shoestring budget that it's bizarre that we actually have the funding to run Domain of One's Own for the next five years, with some space for custom development, a half-time position, etc. But the more I think about it the more I believe I can get used to the whole idea of institutional support and funding pretty quick ??  Additionally, if all the planets align we'll be running a blitz at the end of this semester and into next semester that will get any interested faculty of all experience levels up and running with their own domain and web host to start building out their online portfolios, imagining what it would mean to host their own course sites, etc. And if they already have a domain/web hosting/site, we'll help them imagine what they might do to step up their game another level ? at least for those that we can even help, a few will need to help us! The idea is to fund as many faculty as we can with stipends to do as much as they can in this regard. And to reinforce the process we'll run awards during Spring to highlight and promote the best online portfolios, course design, etc., amongst faculty. If this plan comes together it will be thanks to UMW's Teaching Center director Mary Kayler who has been an awesome addition to Mary Washington and a great friend to DTLT.  I'll be writing about the Domain of One's Own project in more detail in terms of money, cost breakdowns, staffing, etc., once we've worked all those details out. But what has been really encouraging to me is that Emory University has been in contact with us last week about this pilot because they're considering exploring this themselves as soon as next semester. Even cooler, Mark Bousquet is working with E. David Morgen at Emory to make this a reality there. Tim Owens and I have had two conversations with them already, and it's pretty exciting to see other schools express interest in this idea so soon, and for me that's the real trick. Being first isn;t all that important because this isn't some some bogus PR-grabbing iPad initiative, but rather the true value is in the possibility to work alongside other institutions and thinkers to start re-imagining teaching, learning, and IT from the individual out. Having Mark Bousquet interested in this makes it that much more gratifying given I ïve been followed his scholarship as well as his politic on the Chronicle with keen interest over the last five or six years ? not to mention he closes the CUNY circle quite nicely ?? Anyway, I'm not sure if you could tell, but I am starting to get excited by what the future holds down this particular road.  "Jim Groom,Open Dialogue ? Domain of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/open-dialogue-domains-of-ones-own/,11/14/2012,"We recently sent out the following call to all Teaching and Administrative faculty to get the Domain of One's Own pilot in the hands of as many faculty ans staff as possible. What's more, we are partnering with Mary Kayler of the Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation to incentivize the work in order to build a space to showcase research and pedagogy, while exploring the possibilities of their own digital domain for teaching, research, and design.  The more I think about it, the more I would like to frame the experience for all interested faculty and staff as a kind of ds106, aggregated experience that embeds them within an experience of interrogating digital identity, exploring their discipline through social media, creating through various media (images, video, audio), ripping various media (images, video, audio), basic coding, and a more specific look at the space they're taking control over makes the most sense in my mind. What's more, they would all the while be narrating their work and sharing it out through their own space. The possibility of getting more of the faculty sharing their work, getting incentivized to do as much, and hopefully realizing the rich professional possibilities as a result makes me very happy. We've only just begun!  Anyway, below is the announcement for the Open Dialogue around the Domain of One's Own we'll be having this Thursday, November 15th, and again two weeks from Thursday on November 29th..    Attend Open Dialogue ? Domain of One's Own to learn about a groundbreaking UMW digital initiative sponsored by the Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation (CTE & I) and the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT). President Hurley recently provided support so that a number of new domains and hosting can be established along with funding to provide technical support for this new initiative. There are now over 200 UMW students who have established their own domain names and bound their personal learning spaces to them. What's more, there are ten professors who have piloted the initiative this semester by integrating it into their curriculum to varying degrees. Martha Burtis and Alan Levine have their students creating multimedia notebooks/portfolios of their work that they can then archive. Zach Whalen has his students creating their own web spaces that helps them take control and re-conceptualize digital identity. Rosemary Jesionowski is experimenting with art portfolios with her students, and several faculty in History are exploring the implications of their students managing and sharing their research as majors. Tying Domain of One's Own into spaces that students own and take with them further reinforces teaching and learning doesn't end at the university's border. And when these students graduate their sites do not evaporate like discarded blue books. They live on as part of the students' own personal clouds.  Open Dialogue panel members Jim Groom, Tim Owens, Mary Kayler, Zach Whalen, and Haley Campbell will give you an overview of the initiative designed to provide resources and support for faculty to develop a domain of one's own. Building and designing your own professional and/or class spaces allows you to experiment, document, and innovate in the space of digital pedagogy and scholarship.  To incentivize this process, we are also having an Open Call for faculty to partner with DTLT and CTE & I in the development of a professional online presence. You will get your own domain, web hosting, and a stipend (not to mention support) to develop a professional online identity, ranging anywhere from an online CV/ E-Portfolio, to a developmental space to an alternative class space online. We are accepting all levels of technology proficiency. What's more, we also encourage those who already have sites to apply in order to continue to develop out their online presence. Please go here to apply for this initiative by no later than December 2nd, 2012 (11:55pm).  Additionally, becoming part of this initiative will enable you to be considered for CTE & I's new Digital Pedagogy & Scholarship Fellowship to be awarded Spring, 2012. The details surrounding the Digital Pedagogy & Scholarship Fellowship will be formally announced on November 16th on the Center's website (http://academics.umw.edu/teach), but be sure to come on the 15th to get a sense of the initiative and how you might be able to participate.  This is an Open Call; everyone is welcome and invited to engage in this new initiative. Faculty who have limited technology expertise or faculty who have a well established website are encouraged to participate in this initiative. This is an opportunity to provide you with support (collegial, monetary, and resources) to engage in this important work.  Domain of One's Own Co-sponsored Initiative includes:  a. Successful completion of application (located on CTE & I and DTLE websites).  Due: December 2, 2012 by 11:55pm.   b. Agreement and participation in bi-monthly workshops that are designed to  support your domain development and creation  c. Construct a digital e-portfolio (aligned with Digital Pedagogy & Scholarship  Fellowship criteria)  d. Upon successful completion faculty will receive a stipend.  Digital Pedagogy and Scholarship Fellowship. CTE & I will award 2-5 Digital Pedagogy & Scholarship Fellowship this spring semester. Award winners will receive $1,000.00 for the first year and $1,000.00 for professional development the following academic year. You can self-nominate or be peer nominated. You do not need to participate in the Domain of One's Own initiative to be considered. However, you will need to have an e-portfolio that clearly meets the Digital Pedagogy & Scholarship Fellowship criteria.  Kind regards,  CTE & I and DTLT  "Jim Groom,A Domain of One's Own Elevator Pitch?,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-elevator-pitch/,11/30/2012,"Image credit: Jose R. Borras ""elevator""  Last night I was invited by Steve Hargadon to talk about Domain of One's Own as part of his Future of Education series. It was a fun talk because I don't really have a pitch for Domain of One's Own as of yet ? although it quickly became apparent that's what some folks were looking for. The idea is still free-flowing, top-of-my-head thinking about our work at UMW over the last seven years starting with the Bluehost experiment to UMW Blogs to ds106. In fact, as I noted earlier today Haley Campbell may be the one who is most effectively communicating the spirit behind this initiative.  As for the Domain of One's Own elevator pitch (which I was asked to give by Steve to placate the back channel's demand for clarification), I'm really not overly interested in simplifying the idea too much at this point. I would rather it remain a bit amorphous and undetermined. I want it to be shaped by those who participate in the process, and by extension, define its contours. With UMW Blogs, and ds106 as well, we found there's a real value to letting the meaning of an initiative like this emerge without too quickly packaging it as an eportfolio or personal brand. In my mind it's a discursive practice whereby the meaning emerges as a result of the ongoing thinking and participation, to know it you must become part of it ? -but I'm not sure too many folks would appreciate that as an elevator pitch!  I had fun with the chat room last night, they were pretty feisty?which in turn got me riled up. At some point I started repeating: ""THIS is the antidote to the nonsense!!! THIS is the antidote to the nonsense!!!"" The conversation went from Domain of One's Own to MOOCs to me going at it with the chat room ? now that's the arc you want your presentation to take ?? Anyway, if you are interested the video archive of the presentation is here (which will let you see the chat which is important to get a sense of my reactions) and then there's the straight audio here. Finally, the talk was cross-casted to ds106radio, and there Grant Potter had some fun sampling some Lebowski bombs over the discussion (my favorite version).  "Jim Groom,A Domain of One's own and the Realism of the Web,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-and-the-realism-of-the-web/,11/30/2012,"We're lucky to be doing what we're doing here at the University of Mary Washington. We've been on a pretty hot streak for the last seven or eight years when it comes to innovation, and for many of us the Domain of One's Own is an exciting, authentic culmination of years of work distributed amongst thousands of people. I could come up with a laundry list of things we've been working towards over that time period: openness, liberation, fun, alternatives, empowerment, etc.  But the most intelligent and inspired vision of what we've been after was recently articulated by Haley Campbell, a UMW senior and ds106 internaut, who absolutely nailed what this moment of teaching and learning through the web means for our faculty and students alike. She frames the realism as the web as departure from the rhetoric of the web as a scary, alterior space to one that we more fully inhabit, take ownership of, and by extension shape and are shaped by. A sense of being on the web that for me is at the heart of Domain of One's Own. At it's heart this project is not about an eportfolio or self- promotion or being the first search result on Google ? though it can be any and all of those things ? its about becoming through this medium, integrating it into the very fabric of your identity both online and off. And the short clip below of Haley talking about the realism of the web brought it all home for me:  Haley Campbell on the Realism of the Web from umwnewmedia on Vimeo.  When you've got a spokeswoman like Haley, it's hard not to get excited about Domain of One's Own at UMW. And last night was another good example that its quickly moving from collective fantasy to communal reality. We had our Open Dialogue about the initiative and were greeted with upwards of 25 new faculty who are interested in joining a 6-week mini-course this Spring to experiment with their own domains and web host. None of which would be possible without our partnership with Mary Kayler, who runs our Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation, who has been nothing short of awesome to work with. Through her expertise and excitement we've been able to frame this as a much larger teaching and learning initiative that will be supporting faculty technically, pedagogically, and financially ( a holy trinity! ?? ). Next up is to try and do just as much for all Freshman come Fall 2013, but more on that in time ? baby steps!  What's even crazier is Mary Kayler came in early this week with a copy of Martin Weller's The Digital Scholar which she had be reading over the weekend and asked me if I knew this British character from the Open University. I fessed up, and we decided to make it the defining reading of the mini-course for faculty, and hopefully have him talk with the faculty remotely or, even better, here in the flesh in Civilwarland!

You can listen to the half hour long episode here.  What I'm enjoying about conversations like this about Domain of One's Own is that the concept is starting to make a bit more sense in my mind as people push me to frame it as succinctly as possible. It's not easy because, as Jeff and Warren note, at its core Domain of One's Own is ""heady stuff""  ? it's a conceptual shift in how we think about controlling data, syndicating content, aggregating ideas, and, more importantly for UMW's purposes, empowering faculty and students alike.  There's no one easy way to frame this project as an elevator pitch because it's a very small, experimental instantiation of a much larger vision of Jon Udellïs that pushes us to imagine highly personalized digital domains wherein we manage myriad elements of our online lives from school work to personal photos to dental records to electric bills. A private/public domain of personal data that tells the stories of our lives and as a result is crucial for us to control and decide who sees what and what goes where. A digital social security number of sorts, a tolken that is secure and frames a context digitally that was heretofore not only been unnecessary, but unimaginable.  And all of this is that much cooler because two hours before this interview I got to sit down with Krystyn Moon's History Research Methods course that is piloting the Domain of One's Own project to get a sense of what their experience has been thus far. I was surprised at how effusive they were. They were excited about the idea of having a personalized portfolio of their work they owned, they also liked the idea that they (and their parents) could find the domain on Google. I became the object of bragging rights with their friends at other colleges that didn't have this option ? how awesome is that?! What's more, they were wrapping their heads around subdomains, the possibilities of imagining such a space for organizing their academic lives.  I was blown away by both how thoughtful and genuinely interested these students were, but not everything they said was positive. They felt it was coming way too late in their careers (most were Sophomores or Juniors); they wanted access to this space and how it works as Freshman, and they felt it would be important to integrate it into the Freshman seminars somehow ? if only as a week-long how-to and here's what it is. In that way every Freshman would be exposed to the initiative and have the option to experiment ? which is encouraging because that is exactly what were thinking for the rollout in Fall 2013. There was also concerns about support and this project being more closely attended to than we have thus far. More documentation, more class time, and more experimentation with what they have ? all things we are gearing up for now. Kudos to Krystyn Moon and her students for not only taking the time to really experiment with Domains of One's Own this semester, but also for spending a class giving us feedback for the pilot. I am hoping Andy Rush and I can sit down with a few of these students and get some of their amazing reflections and suggestions documented for follow-up video to The Culture of Innovation gem. It's getting very exciting up in here!  "Larry McCallum,A r?sum? of one's own |,https://larrymccallum.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/a-domain-of-ones-own/,12/11/2012,"> ""All of them hurry to Bath, because here, without any further qualification, they can mingle with the princes and nobles of the land. Even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen, who, like shovel-nosed sharks, prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune, are infected with the same rage of displaying their importanceƒ The husband, therefore, must provide an entire house, or elegant apartments in the new buildings."" Tobias Smollett, The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, 1771.  Last week I attended a conference at which an excited man from an East Coast university extolled the benefits of giving every student a personal webspace on which to forge his or her own ""online identity"" and ""personal learning network"".  This ""pedagogy of uncertainty"" (so labeled because it's unregulated and entails a modicum of institutional risk) encourages self-discovery among students, said the speaker, Jim Groom. He's director of Teaching and Learning Technology at the University of Mary Washington, in Virginia, where he has implemented such a program, called A Domain of One's Own.  Perhaps because it's still evolving, Groom has been at pains to define the program's benefits, describing it variously as:     ""heady stuffƒ a conceptual shift in how we think about controlling data, syndicating content, aggregating ideas, and, more importantlyƒ empowering faculty and students alike""; or,    a ""digital social security number of sorts, a tolken [sic] that is secure and frames a context digitally that was heretofore not only been [sic] unnecessary, but unimaginable""; or simply,    ""a personalized portfolio of their work"".  It also fosters a richer understanding, he told the conference, of our era's most pervasive medium: ""How can we think critically about identity on the Web if we don't inhabit that space.""  It was hard not to agree when he put it that way, and in fact some learning theory does support having students publish online in various forms, which is why legions of teachers have been doing so. However, I had to wonder: self- discovery or self-indulgence? Critical thinking or crass distraction? I'm sure much learning can come from this initiative, and that it fits admirably with the current zeitgeist, and yet it gives me pause. Perhaps it's just the language used.  In fact, I recall a similar concept from one of my grad courses in educational technology  ?  the instructor posited that people would be better off if technology existed for tracking and storing everything a person does, so the true sum of all his minor achievements might be leveraged for career advantage.  In another course, though, I was told to beware of the false promise of ïtechnolust'.  But come to think of it, faculty routinely do track and store their activities as part of the academic enterprise  ?  every little community service, conference or webinar attendance, in hopes that listing these activities in their annual activity reports will improve their prospects for promotion or tenure.  Groom pointed out that young people engage in image-grooming on Facebook and the like anyway, but he likened that to ""sharecropping"", insofar as corporations own the content and can whisk it away (or sell the data) at any time.  But isn't shaping an online identity what corporations themselves do obsessively? So, does grooming a personal Web identity turn a person into his own spin doctor, not to mention a mirror-gazer unduly concerned with appearance?  I know I run the risk of sounding like a harrumphing, hidebound stick-in-the- mud, pining for a mythical time when kids were, gosh, just kids. But it did used to be the case that students merely stuffed their typewritten assignments in a forgotten desk drawer, if they kept them at all. In a pre-looking-glass world no one cared about your long-ago minutiae  ?  and really, I doubt anyone does today. So why are we fetishising these things, implicitly telling students that their ""portfolios"" will matter? Because it reflects well on universities as career-engines?  But what do I know? The world has whirled on its axis. I came of age when young women wore shapeless dresses and no makeup as a matter of pride. Today, campuses are fashion shows and female students would-be sexpots. Boys pump iron. Campus events feature German cars and local radio stations, but nothing deliberately political.  Groom fits this vibe better than I do. He uses a comic-book-superhero avatar, speaks in a steady stream of movie references, peppers his writings with high- wattage expressions (""excited"", ""blown away""), and runs a sidebar of ""testimonials"" adjacent to every blog post. (Ed tech, like many spheres, can be a heady mutual-admiration society, as the conference bore out.) So let's drink deeply of the Domaine de Moi-mme, or whatever vintage (in new bottles) we're tasting this week. After all, it's empowering, whatever that means.  Indeed, it's a pedagogy of uncertainty.  ### Like this:  Like Loading...  ### Related  "Jim Groom,"Babyboomers Eat Babies, or a Weak Critique of Domain of One's Own",http://bavatuesdays.com/babyboomers-eat-babies-or-a-weak-critique-of-domain-of-ones-own/,12/11/2012,"Larry McCallum, Web Librarian for Thompson River University (TRU), posted his thoughts about my presentation on Domain of One's Own this past Friday at The Day for Learning conference.

(Ed tech, like many spheres, can be a heady mutual-admiration society, as the conference bore out.)  Attacking me as a meth-head hipster I can understand, but the students? NOT THE STUDENTS!!! Funny thing is, I was lucky enough to hear two awesome TRU students, Ryan and Mark, talk at the conference this past Friday. And oddly enough, they looked and acted nothing like the caricatured vision of students that McCallum frames above, which is a shame cause I wanted to see some sexpotted muscles in a BMW listening to Kamloops radio. In fact, Mark and Ryan were passionate, articulate, in decent shape (but not particularly muscular), and intellectually engaged with the idea that a university can deeply challenge and shape one's evolving notions of self and identity.  I appreciate McCallum's post because it helps define the contours of the project for me a bit better?particularly what it is not. The one, half-thought out critique McCallum had suggested was how an online identity project like this apes the brand-driven reality of the third-party services I seem to be railing against.  > But isn't shaping an online identity what corporations themselves do obsessively? So, does grooming a personal Web identity turn a person into his own spin doctor, not to mention a mirror-gazer unduly concerned with appearance?  I guess if UMW were centered around navel gazing and spin doctoring I'd respond affirmatively to the rhetorical question above. But it's not ? and I am sure TRU isn't either. Our courses are a space to empower students, encourage and engage critical thought, and think deeply about the full complement of problems and possibilities our historical moment presents. Why would the intellectual by-products of such a process be understood as morose narcissism? Is he inferring students have no power to think critically about the web landscape they find themselves in and how it relates to all domains of learning across the university? Does he question the ability of professors to engage this conversation alongside them? If so, why is he working at a university at all?  I guess the only thing that pains me more than not being able to articulate Domain of One's Own is a patent dismissal of the quality of work that students produce:  > I know I run the risk of sounding like a harrumphing, hidebound stick-in- the-mud, pining for a mythical time when kids were, gosh, just kids. [NOOOOO!] But it did used to be the case that students merely stuffed their typewritten assignments in a forgotten desk drawer, if they kept them at all. In a pre- looking-glass world no one cared about your long-ago minutiae  ?  and really, I doubt anyone does today. So why are we fetishising these things, implicitly telling students that their ""portfolios"" will matter? Because it reflects well on universities as career-engines?  So, to recast this a bit, we should be telling students their work doesn't matter, their ideas are meaningless minutia, and they'll be happy we destroyed all their data for them. To misquote Nobody quoting William Blake: ""The vision of university that thou doth see is my vision's greatest enemy."" There could not be a statement more opposed to the vision that has inspired the work of Domain of One's Own. It celebrates the meaningless dance of  our subsumption into an alienating and disempowering system and nostalgically immortalizes it as the pre-looking-glass ""good ole days."" That's not only bad history, it's downright dangerous thinking! Are those the same good ole days of racial segregation of First Nation residential schools? (As an aside, one of the most powerful presentations I've ever seen took place earlier in the day when Estella spoke of her experience at a residential school in the 1950s ? which makes McCallum's ""mutual admiration society"" comment in reference to the conference that much stranger, not to mention his vision of the past as somehow purer that much creepier.)  The comment I left on McCallum's blog earlier today was far more conciliatory than this post. I was trying to start a conversation, even though his tone suggested he would probably not be interested in one (which makes me wonder why he used trackbacks to this blog to begin with). But the more I thought about it, the more I started to think his post was not only rude (which it definitely was), but also quite hostile to the core of what I believe as an educational technologist. And whether or not he had any intention of publishing my earlier comment (I am including it below), I figured I would post this as a response in my own space that he can't control. And if it turns out all he really wanted to do was offer a weak intellectual critique of my idea in order to attack the academic caliber of the students and faculty at his institution, then I figured simply pointing all this out on the bava would be enough of a response. Suck it.  Here is my earlier comment, which I now formally retract ??  > Larry,  >  > I appreciate this post because it helps define the contours of the project for me a bit better. I really don't know where this leads, and the question of online identity can quickly become a brand-driven reality. I particularly like this comment:  >  > ""But isn't shaping an online identity what corporations themselves do obsessively? So, does grooming a personal Web identity turn a person into his own spin doctor, not to mention a mirror-gazer unduly concerned with appearance?""  >  > For me the question is how do we engage the idea of online identity as greater than the omnipresent vision of branding? Might there be a more authentic vision (and I understand how problematic a term like authentic might seem from a comic book character edtech person  ) wherein an academic community can support and encourage students and faculty alike to enter into a discourse around their professional field, hobbies, and/or passions. I am wondering if a space that students are asked to consider and experiment as an intellectual and personal journey of sharing and reflecting through on their learning might lead to some interesting possibilities. We've had some greta success with this with UMW Blogs already, and I think what Domain of One's Own adds to this discussion, if anything, to talk to the ShatteredAccountants points, is the ability for students to have a deeper understanding of how these services and the corporate exchange in data during our moments shales them in ways they can;t control. I appreciate the candid feedback because it helps me further fine tune a vision that is still very much emerging, and the fact that it remains deeply uncertain is why it is attractive to me, which may be a psychological issue  Thanks for coming and engaging the ideas, but more than that sharing back your response to them.  "Larry McCallum,"Babyboomers Eat Babies, or a Weak Critique of Domain of One's Own ~ Stephen Downes",http://www.downes.ca/post/59607,12/12/2012,"Jim Groom isn't particularly thrilled with recent criticism of his ""A Domain of One's Own"" presentation. I think that the presentation itself makes a good point; for my own part I find hosting my own domain insulates me from arbitrary policy changes and marketing practices common on hosted platforms such as Google, Facebook or Twitter. But critic Larry McCallum m,ay have a point about the presentation. He writes that Groom ""uses a comic-book- superhero avatar, speaks in a steady stream of movie references, peppers his writings with high-wattage expressions ('excited', 'blown away'), and runs a sidebar of 'testimonials' adjacent to every blog post."" And he - like myself - is rather less inclined than Groom to self-identify and express oneself through (mostly commercial) cultural icons and images.  I don't think this is generational, I think it's cultural. I would say that Canadians, for example, prefer a much more grounded, more local, softer, and more personal form of self-identification. We don't go in for marching bands, flag-waving, visual effects, super-heroes and explosions quite the way Americans do (probably no other culture does). We don't identify quite so much with corporate icons (other than hockey teams), scenes from movies or television stars. And we definitely don't do the sort of personal branding or self-marketing that we find south of the border. So the Groom style of presentation feels a bit plastic, glitzy, over-the-top and, yes, self- indulgent. That's OK; it works in his own environment. But maybe not so much here.  "Jim Groom,Nothing is lost,http://bavatuesdays.com/nothing-is-lost/,12/13/2012,"Anil Dash has quite an remarkable post titled the ""Web We Lost"" (thans for the heads up Tim). I really like the bit below because it gets right at the heart of the Domain of One's Own pilot we are running at the University of Mary Washington.  > In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity. In this vision, you would own your own domain name and have complete control over its contents, rather than having a handle tacked on to the end of a huge company's site. This was a sensible reaction to the realization that big sites rise and fall in popularity, but that regular people need an identity that persists longer than those sites do.  That's beautifully stated, my only problem with that post (like many eulogies about the good ole days of the web five years ago) is that nothing is lost. Sure folks might have fallen into the corporate silos, but there is plenty of time to re-examine those choices and re-imagine the future. To this end I recently ordered (and just received) Jon Udellïs Practical Internet Groupware because I'm increasingly inspired and fascinated by the ideas that started to break open both the thinking and reality of web as distributed platform. I want to get a sense of the thinking more than a decade ago in this realm in order to approach this particular bullet point by Anil Dash with a larger and deeper context rather than through the omnipresent apocalyptic ruins of the now.  Udell's thinking represents a refreshing, optimistic approach to understanding why the web we are working towards is anything but lost. In a recent post on the Wired blog, ""Goodbye Fax, Hello Personal Cloud,"" he uses a story of sorting through the quagmire of medical bills and insurance claims to unpack the vision of a personalized domain as far more than an online address, but as an aggregator, syndicator, and router wrapped into one wherein we control and streamline the processes of connecting and communicating our personal information:  > I authorize them to access my personal cloud. And the authorization is granular. The auto insurer has write access, so it can poke the Exhaustion of Benefits (EOB) token into my cloud data store, but no read access, because it doesn't need that. The hospital and the clinic have read access to just that one document. (Separately they have write access so they can poke bills into my data store.) The hospital and the clinic can also subscribe to notifications, so when the EOB token hits my cloud they know it's there and can access it. Since all access to my cloud is audited, I know when that happens  ?  or if it doesn't.  We're faced with myriad problems that impede effective communication on a daily basis, how can a more intelligent design and architecture of the web help us solve some of those problems? This is the basic question Udell seems to approach most issues he faces ona regular basis, and it's why I find myself returning to his work. There's no doom and gloom sensationalism, rather its equal parts pragmatism and idealism, and all class. I want to be compelled to think long and hard about how we can teach for the future so that Johnny Can Syndicate ? not play forlorn so that we can stop taking responsibility for what's happening to the web.  "Jim Groom,7 Years Later,http://bavatuesdays.com/7-years-later/,12/13/2012,"Today is the seven year anniversary of bavatuesdays. Andy Rush and I are working on a more creative take on the bava's anniversary coming soon that'll pay homage to my third year on the bava post, so stay tuned. Seven years is a decent amount of time to have spent regularly documenting and sharing the work I've done, and what's always special about December 13th for me is that it also marks my seven year anniversary at UMW.  Add to that the fact I just passed the 2000 posts mark (2002 to be exact) and over 10,000 comments (10,261) you can see I am the proprietor of a regular blogging empire. On average, I've written 286 posts a year with roughly 5 comments per post. That stat blows my mind (basically a post everyday save weekends). The heavy traffic on this site came and went back in 2008 and 2009, but the habit of writing and creating hasn't waned as a result. In fact, back in July of 2009 I wrote my 1000th post, which is almost exactly three and a half years ago, suggesting there is a regular rhythm to the process for me. I love the dogged, everydayness of blogging ? it has become the last of my bad habits.  The site has seen the birth of UMW Blogs, EDUPUNK, Edtech Survivalist, ds106, Summer of Oblivion, hardboiled,and Domain of One's Own to name just a few of its idea babies. The tale of the tape is all here. I have brought it hard the last seven years, and I am proud of that fact. Blogging has enabled me a voice I wouldn't have had otherwise, and while the traveling and presentations have grown laborious for me as of late, I've never gotten tired of the blogging. It's my space, it's a part of who I am, and it reflects all the ideas, dreams, and possibilities I come across in my thinking about film, literature, storytelling, edtech, and much more. It has been an ongoing conversation about media of all kinds, and while not always pretty ? and I make to apologies for any of it ?  its as authentic a space for personal expression as I can muster.  Oddly enough, I still can't seem to avoid the occasional controversy despite the fact I am evermore congenial, but even that is pretty trivial and ridiculous when I think about it. This space continues to be an evolving document of my thinking, and that is something anyone else out there can take or leave, but for me its a goldmine of my intellectual development, and you can be sure the bava isn't going anywhere anytime soon. That said, I am gonna spend much of the next month-long vacation reflecting on the hardboiled class, working through the Internet of Attractions ideas, doing a general clean-up and archive of the bava (still suffering after my YouTube account shutdown), work around cassa bava, as well as some engage in some serious gaming (that's the one part of my life I have been failing at for the last seven years). So, here's to seven year's on the bava and all the irreparable harm its caused me.  "Audrey Watters,Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012: Data and Learning Analytics,https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/top-ed-tech-trends-2012-data-and-learning-analytics,12/20/2012,"Part 7 of my Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012 series  I chose ""data"" as one of the top trends of 2011, and the opening line of that article reads ""If data was an important trend for 2011, I predict it will be even more so in 2012."" Indeed. There's a great deal that happened in 2012 that's a continuation of what we saw last year  ?  enough that I could probably just copy-and-paste from the article I wrote back then:  > More of our activities involve computers and the Internet, whether it's for work, for school, or for personal purposes. Thus, our interactions and transactions can be tracked. As we click, we leave behind a trail of data?something that's been dubbed ""data exhaust."" It's information that's ripe for mining and analysis, and thanks to new technology tools, we can do so in real time and at a massive, Web scale.  >  > There's incredible potential for data analytics to impact education. We already collect a significant amount of data about school and students (attendance, demographics, test scores, free and reduced lunches, and the like), but much of it is administrative and/or siloed and/or unexamined.  >  > ƒDespite the promise of personalized learning through analytics and data, what we've actually seen this year is an increasing emphasis on standardization (or rather, standardized testing). And as such, most of the stories about education data this year have been stories about testing. Stories about dismal test scores. Stores about teachers' performance tied to those student test scores. Stories about cheating.  It's no wonder that talk about ""data"" (or its variation ""data-driven"") continues to make lots of folks shudder.  What Counts as ""Education Data""?  ""It would be nice if all of the data which sociologists require could be enumerated because then we could run them through IBM machines and draw charts as the economists do. However, not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."" ? William Bruce Cameron (1963)  But what do we mean by ""education data""? And do we risk, as the Cameron quote (often attributed to Einstein) suggests, valuing the wrong thing by focusing on certain data and certain measurements?  ""Education data"" is more than just standardized test scores, of course (but if you're keeping track at home, SAT scores were down this year and the ACT scores remained flat). For some other interesting education data from the year, we can look at U.S. poverty rates (up) or median household income (down); how much states in fact spend on standardized testing; how much for- profit schools spend on advertising; the impact of iPads on literacy among Maine's kindergarteners; the state of wiki usage in K?12 schools; online forum usage in higher ed; how much is invested in ed-tech startups; high school graduation rates; employment rates for college grads; where the Gates Foundation spends its money; how many teens own smartphones (55.5%); crime rates in schools (down); youth suicide rates (up); the enrollment of special education students at charter schools; the metadata on the Harvard University Libraries collections; demographics of MOOC enrollees; the confidence on public schools (an all time low); who has student loan debt and how much; how much adjunct faculty earn; how well students perform in virtual schools; and how the physics of Angry Birds works (and what you can learn from it).  What can you learn from it  ?  from all this data? Great question  ?  one that many journalists, politicians, entrepreneurs, government officials, researchers, and others have sought to answer this year. The promise of this data they argue is that through mining and modeling, we can enhance student learning and predict student success.  The Politics of Education Data  ""Data, data everywhere and not a drop to drink"" ? The Rime of the Ancient Psychometrician  The Department of Education pushed that promise of ""big data"" in a big way this year. In April, it issued a draft report on data mining and learning analytics that tried to make the case for how these practices will transform education. (The final version of the report was released in October.)  The department's interest in data and analytics are connected to a number of other key initiatives, including the 2010 National Education Technology Plan and the Obama Administration's funding competition Race to the Top (RTTT). The latter demanded states and districts conform to a number of data-oriented reforms, including ""supporting data systems that inform decisions and improve instruction, by fully implementing a statewide longitudinal data system, assessing and using data to drive instruction, and making data more accessible to key stakeholders.""  Of course, RTTT emphasizes data in other ways too  ?  namely, more standardized testing, and in turn, then using that data to assess teachers. Once again, we're back to just thinking that the education data that ""counts"" are test scores. And as in 2011, this became highly politicized when teachers' names and associated test score data were made public.  In February, following a lengthy legal battle, the city of New York released data about almost 18,000 individual math and English teachers' performance. The Teacher Data Reports ranked teachers based on their students' gains on the state's math and English tests over the course of 5 years (up until the 2009?2010 academic year).  Also known as ""value-added assessment,"" the data is purported to demonstrate how much a teacher ""adds value,"" if you will, to students' academic gains. By looking at students' previous scores, researchers have developed a model that predicts how much improvement is expected over the course of a school year. Whether students perform better or worse than expected is then tied to the impact that a particular teacher had.  Proponents of value-added assessment  ?  that includes Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and former NYC School Chancellor (and now head of News Corp's education division) Joel Klein  ?  argue that this model demonstrates teachers' effectiveness, and as such should be used to help determine how to compensate teachers, as well as who to fire.  While the teacher's union and teachers have been vocal in their opposition to the city's move to release this data, they aren't the only ones deeply skeptical and deeply troubled by this particular measurement  ?  let alone the appearance of individual teachers' names and rankings in local newspapers. Arguing that ""shame is not the solution,"" even ed-reformer Bill Gates penned an op-ed in The New York Times arguing the release of the Teacher Data Reports was a bad idea.  In no small part, that's because there are many problems with relying on value-added assessments to determine a teacher's effectiveness. First and foremost, of course, it reduces the impact that a teacher has on a student to a question of standardized test scores. How does a teacher help boost a student's confidence, critical thinking, inquisitiveness, creativity? What about other subjects other than math or English? What about teachers whose students are gifted, have disabilities or are still learning English? (Well, according to VAM, they're ""bad teachers."" The ""worst"" math teacher in NYC, in fact, had many students who received perfect scores  ?  but as these students hadn't improved from previously stellar scores, wellƒ) What about poverty and other socio-economic influences on students' lives?  Furthermore, there is a sizable margin of error in these value-added assessments. As The New York Times notes, the scores could be off as much as 54 to 100 points, and the city is only ""95 percent sure a ranking is accurate."" As Gotham Schools reported several years ago, the margin of error has meant that ""31 percent of English teachers who ranked in the bottom quintile of teachers in 2007 had jumped to one of the top two quintile by 2008. About 23 percent of math teachers made the same jump."" Did these teachers suddenly get better? We just don't know.  The Business of Education Data and Learning Analytics  Not knowing hasn't stopped us from assessing, measuring, monitoring, and mining, (and from condemning, damning, and dismissing teachers). Nor has it stopped the testing industry from expanding and profiting  ?  something that will continue to occur with the new Common Core State Standards and their associated testing requirements. (According to a recently released study by the Brookings Institute, the states spend about $1.7 billion per year on testing in K?12.)  But a ridiculously impossible question about pineapples and hares on the (Pearson-developed) New York State eighth grade language arts exam  ?  one where based on a wonderfully absurdist story by children's author Daniel Pinkwater and one where every multiple choice answer was equally right or wrong  ?  helped draw attention to the problems of these tests' design and usage. (You can read the passage and the test questions here.)  ""Pineapples don't have sleeves.""  ?  New York State 8th Grade ELA Exam  Nevertheless big data was big business in 2012, and lots of companies released data and analytics products, including:  Shared Learning Collaborative: This Gates Foundation-funded initiative was best explained this year by Frank Calatano who used ""buckets"" and ""spigots"" to describe the SLC's infrastructure plans: K?12 data stores, APIs, and Learning Registry-related content tags. (More to come on the SLC in my next Top Ed-Tech Trends post.)  Learnsprout: A graduate of the ImagineK12 program, Learnsprout is API-focused startup helping schools integrate other products with their SISes. It raised $1 million funding from Andreessen Horowitz and participated in Code for America this year. (I wrote about the startup here; more to come.)  Clever: Backed by Y Combinator, Clever also launched this year with an API-oriented solution to the problems of SIS data siloes. It raised $3 million funding from Ashton Kutcher, Mitch Kapor, and others. (More to come on Clever.)  Kaggle: The data mining/machine learning competition site Kaggle hosted several education-related contests, including a Hewlett Foundation-sponsored one on automated essay grading (yes, more to come on that.) Kaggle also hosts ""Kaggle in Class,"" which allows the data mining platform to be used in class-based assignments/contests.  Amplify/Wireless Generation: Rupert Murdoch's plans for his company's education division got a little clearer this year with the unveiling of Amplify in June. News Corp had acquired Wireless Generation and had hired former NYC Schools Chancelor Joel Klein in late 2010. Much of the focus of Amplify remains on what were Wireless Generation's offerings: assesment and analytics. For its part, Wireless Generation remained involved in the development of the Shared Learning Collaborative; and it won a contract to build a Common Core State Standards assessment reporting system.  Kickboard: From New Orleans founded by TFA alum Jen Medbery comes Kickboard, which gives schools and/or teachers a way to track academic and behavioral data, along with family contact, in one dashboard. (I covered Kickboard here.)  Always Prepped: Another data dashboard for teachers, Always Prepped raised $650,000 in seed funding from True Ventures in November.  TeachBoost: Another ImagineK12 alum, TeachBoost offers a school to track teacher's performance data, from classroom observations and evaluations. (I covered TeachBoost here).  Academia.edu: In August, the ""social network for scholars"" Academia.edu launched an analytics dashboard  so that users could track the citations of their research in real-time.  Coursesmart: The largest digital textbook provider, Coursesmart recently launched an analytics tool that tracks a student's usage of an e-book, including page views, time spent in the app, highlights made, notes taken  ?  then notifies the professor of that student's ""engagement score.""  IBM/Desire to Learn: In April, IBM and Desire2Learn announced a partnership for their Smarter Education Solution  ?  one part D2L LMS and one part IBM analytics. Desire2Learn raised $80 million  ?  its first VC investment  ?  this year.  Instructure: In June the LMS startup Instructure unveiled its analytics feature. With it, students can view their assignments, grades, and other performances stats, and they can see how they're doing compared to others. Instructors can see overviews of courses, compare courses, and (ideally at least) identify and help struggling students.  Coursera: The online education startup Coursera announced just last week its plans for Coursera Career Services, whereby students (via performance and geographical data) would be matched with potential employers (See also: MOOCs.)  Udacity: Udacity also offers a similar recruiting service to employers based on students' data (See also: MOOCs.)  Civitas Learning: Founded by Charles Thornburgh, a former exec at Kaplan, Civitas Learning launched a predictive analytics platform to help colleges and universities identify ""at-risk"" students. The company raised $4.1 million in funding this year.  Junyo: 2012 wasn't such a good year for Zyngaƒ errr, former Zynga exec Steve Schoettler's learning analytics startup Junyo, according to Edsurge, which reported on its pivot in September.  Knewton: Arguably Knewton remains the company most synonymous with education data and analytics. Early in the year Fast Company named it one of the world's most innovative companies.  Whose Data Is It Anyway?  ""Data is the new oil""  ?  Marketers, everywhere  We often hear that ""big data is big oil,"" but the metaphor's a lousy one, Jer Thorp (Data Artist in Residence at The New York Times) recently argued, admitting that possibly the ""idea can foster some much-needed criticality.""  > Our experience with oil has been fraught; fortunes made have been balanced with dwindling resources, bloody mercenary conflicts, and a terrifying climate crisis. If we are indeed making the first steps into economic terrain that will be as transformative (and possibly as risky) as that of the petroleum industry, foresight will be key. We have already seen ""data spills"" happen (when large amounts of personal data are inadvertently leaked). Will it be much longer until we see dangerous data drilling practices? Or until we start to see long term effects from ""data pollution""?  What happens when we use the resource extraction metaphor? How does that shape how we view (education) data? Indeed, as Thorp writes, ""where oil is composed of the compressed bodies of long-dead micro-organisms, this personal data is made from the compressed fragments of our personal lives. It is a dense condensate of our human experience.""  Who owns the learning experience? Who owns all this education data? Companies? Schools? Instructors? Students? Do students know what data is being collected about them?  How can we make sure that learning analytics and data mining aren't about extracting value but adding value? How do we make sure that in our rush to uncover insights from all this education data we now capture, that the student isn't just the object of analysis? How do we make sure the student has subjectivity, agency and control  ?  over their data and their learning?  To that end, the Department of Education did launch a MyData initiative this spring (which I covered in April). Much like the Blue Button that allows veterans to access and download their personal medical records from the VA in both human- and machine-readable formats, a MyData button will allow students to download and store (and share as they choose) their personal educational records.  Of course, education data is a lot more complex and distributed. Unlike veterans' data, which is centralized under the VA and Department of Defense, educational data is scattered across the federal, state, and local levels. (The Department of Education only handles financial aid data; it doesn't control our transcript or test data, for example). Education data, as I argue at the beginning of this post, can include all sorts of other things too outside the realm of official institutions: what you read, who you are connected to via social networks, what videos you've watched, what you've built and written and accomplished.  The MyData button, along with personal data lockers, could be seen as part of the growing ""quantified self"" movement, which involves collecting and tracking one's own data through hardware (e.g. sensors like Fitbit), software (e.g. time-tracking tools like Chrometa), and/or handwritten journals and log entries. When applied to learning, there's the possibility then to construct one's own dashboards and visualizations.  As I wrote in a post on the quantified self and learning analytics back in April,  > My concerns ? and maybe ""concern"" is too strong a word ? about the quantified self and learning involve a fixation about transactional data, about the easily quantifiable but in the end meaningless. There are a lot of obvious numbers in our day-to-day lives ? what we read, where we click, what we like, how much time we spend studying, who we talk to and ask for help. It's the administrivia of education. And frankly that seems to be the focus of a lot of ""what counts"" in learning analytics. But does this really help us uncover, let alone diagnose or augment learning? What needs to happen to spur collection and reflection over our data so we can do a better job of this ? not for the sake of the institution, but for the sake of the individual?  One of the year's most important developments around the personal ownership of learning data might be the University of Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own project. The pilot offered some 400 students and faculty at the university their own domain name and Web space and helped them learn how to build their own e-portfolio  ?  the power to control their data, even after they graduate.  As UMW's Jim Groom writes, the Domain of One's Own is  > a conceptual shift in how we think about controlling data, syndicating content, aggregating ideas, and, more importantly for UMW's purposes, empowering faculty and students alike.  >  > There's no one easy way to frame this project as an elevator pitch because it's a very small, experimental instantiation of a much larger vision of Jon Udell's that pushes us to imagine highly personalized digital domains wherein we manage myriad elements of our online lives from school work to personal photos to dental records to electric bills. A private/public domain of personal data that tells the stories of our lives and as a result is crucial for us to control and decide who sees what and what goes where. A digital social security number of sorts, a token that is secure and frames a context digitally that was heretofore not only been unnecessary, but unimaginable.  And that's a vision for our personal learning data that looks quite different from a lot of the data dashboards and analytics tools that many companies and organizations want to sell us.

While working as an instructional technology specialist I've been moonlighting as an alter ego. At first I thought it would be a fling, a one time experiment. But the more I put this new hat on, the darker down the rabbit hole I went. Even now I question who I truly am. You see, in these past 9 months I have been slowly becoming something so mythical I didn't dare speak of it until now. But I can't hide from the truth. I'm becoming a server admin. God that feels good to get off my chest. I'm not a good one mind you, pretty average in fact. But damn do I now have a lot of respect for the profession. As I get ready for the Spring semester I wanted to start really documenting the bits and pieces pulled together that have formed the Domain of One's Own project. What we do at DTLT is no trade secret kept in the dark by patents and magic. The projects we work on and the things we build are things we believe in not just for UMW, but for higher education as a whole. So please copy us. Take this blog post and the several I will be writing over the next few days, print them out, and go have a conversation with the decision-makers at your school about how you can make this happen. Because I absolutely believe it's worth it. Almost a year ago I wrote this post talking about the foundation of building the Domain of One's Own from my point of view. The inspiration was a server commune that I helped start with a lot of help from a bunch of hippies. At the time we were all paying hosting companies upwards of $120-$240/year for hosting and we wondered how we could accomplish sharing a single account and hosting all our domains without giving up the freedom to tinker in the control panel or locking out any individual person. What I learned was that MediaTemple offered a virtual private server account that included a piece of software called Plesk. Plesk could be configured to give each user on the system their own independent control panel with access to their own domains, subdomains, databases. It even had an automated application installer. Recognizing that a virtual private server space could offer something like this was a lightbulb going off for me and the rest of us at DTLT because we started to realize there was no reason we couldn't do this for students. The idea of giving every student their own web host suddenly seemed completely possible and we drew together a plan that our CIO backed and funded to run a pilot for one year. After just 6 months of the successful pilot we had so much success and buy-in from the administration that we've gotten fully funded to roll the project out to all freshman next year. Our dream to give students these spaces to own their actions online and build out their own part of the web is becoming a reality. I plan to talk more about the software including Plesk in a later post, but I wanted to begin by talking about hosting. Being familiar with MediaTemple from my use of them with Hippie Hosting I asked them to submit a bid for the project and I was pleased to see them win it. They're not the cheapest host but the support has been good for a pilot of this size. For the pilot we've been using their Dedicated Virtual Server (dv) plan with 200GB of hard drive space, 4GB of memory, and 3TB of bandwidth. We allocated 250mb of space per user and 10GB of bandwidth. In hindsight I could be even more generous because there is a long tail of unused resources for the majority of users. The average site gets very little traffic (although Alan Levine blogged about the first major traffic hit we got here). As I mentioned before what really appealed to me about using MediaTemple as a host was that they offered the Plesk software as a part of their service. There was one aspect of the project that MediaTemple was not suited for. Due to the way we had to bundle the project for purchasing the same company that handled our hosting also had to handle domain registrations for the 400 pilot users. Normally this wouldn't be an issue since MediaTemple offers domain registrations at $12/year for a variety of top-level domains. But what we found was that their system was very inflexible for allowing the students to select and register the domain themselves. MediaTemple billed us and then converted the amount for the domains to a service credit to bill against (good so far). But the only way you can register a new service (including domains) with a service credit is by support ticket. This meant for the 235 domains we registered last fall I had to enter every single one in by hand into bulk service tickets for MediaTemple to register. I also had to change the nameservers for every domain after MediaTemple registered them. Not an ideal situation and definitely not sustainable in the long run. What we want to do (and what you should want to do if you're thinking of implementing a project like this) is work with a company like eNom that allows you to be your own domain reseller. Essentially you hand them a pot of money and when a user registers a domain in your system they fund it from your balance, apply the standard nameservers that you setup yourself previously, and the whole thing is automated. eNom has a robust API to tap into and in fact Plesk will register domains and add them into the hosting ecosystem using that API with very little legwork on your part. I'll also be talking more in a future post about how this domain registration automation works. So in terms of hosting we had the option of using our own hardware (a server in the IT department running a local copy of the Plesk software), a virtual private server with a specific set of specifications, or a dedicated virtual private server with dedicated resources (both virtual and dedicated private servers are ""cloud- based"" services). Since we didn't need a ton of resources and this was just a pilot the virtual private server option made sense. We may decide in future iterations of the Domain of One's Own to bring it inhouse with our own harder to keep up with the growing need for space and resources. But companies like Rackspace have also made virtual and dedicated servers that scale with demand an option and the use of real-time storage that grows as you need it with something like Amazon S3 provide a lot of options here. We went with MediaTemple for the simplicity during the pilot but will likely be exploring some of these options moving forward for a more stable production server with room for growth whether that be cloud-based or housed on campus.  "Tim Owens,Building a Domain of One's Own: The Panel,https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-domain-of-ones-own-the-panel/,1/3/2013,"In part one of this series I talked about our different hosting options for running the Domain of One's Own project. In many ways those options are no different than any major project a school might be considering whether it be a new LMS, a blogging platform like UMW Blogs, or something else. You can run it in house or host it with a company. In the end I think support plays a big factor in that discussion. If you have the people and expertise to run a server with the software in house it's likely a better option because you get more bang for your buck, but hosting the server with a company that does that kind of thing fulltime will certainly ease the burden if you don't have the manpower or expertise on campus. In this post I want to talk more about the panel software running on the server that allows users to create subdomains, databases, software installs, email addresses, and other powerful things to make it truly a flexible open space for publishing and being on the web. For the pilot of Domain of One's Own we used the Parallels Plesk control panel software. Plesk is a robust control panel for web hosting that allows you to have ""customers"" with their own control panels completely segregated. Combined with the Customer and Business Manager Add-On you can have users sign up as customers and automatically be provisioned hosting with their account on the server. During the sign up process the user (in our case students and faculty) would create a new account, choose their domain, and ""checkout"". In a matter of seconds the hosting would be setup and a confirmation and welcome email sent to the user (the caveat to this was the domain registration for us which took a lot longer because it was not automated at the time and required a support ticket). Once the user's hosting was provisioned they could log in and have full access to begin building out their space. So what do I mean by ""building out their space""? Here is just a small sample of the things available to our students and faculty using the system:     Creating subdomains (http://whatever.mydomain.com)    Creating personal email addresses (me@mydomain.com) that either hosted the email on the server or forwarded to another address of their choice.    Installing software (Plesk comes with an Application Vault with lots of open source software including Wordpress, Drupal, etc to make this a matter of a few clicks)    Creating databases    Managing their DNS to point specific domains to custom services like Tumblr or UMW Blogs    Managing their file system    Viewing statics about the traffic to their domains  For many of our students this was brand new territory for them so we put together a lot of documentation (still an ongoing process) with tutorials on how to accomplish these tasks. Using the administrative account also gave us full access to see everyone's control panels to help them troubleshoot specific problems as they came up without having to request their account information. We chose Plesk because MediaTemple provided it as part of their dedicated virtual server offering and to be honest, this was all a new horizon for us and having a system installed for us was one less hurdle to implementing the pilot in such a short amount of time and for such a large group. That being said we will likely not use Plesk after the pilot is over and we roll out the project to all freshman. I won't say that it has been an unpleasant experience using Plesk, but the support leaves a lot to be desired and third party support is severely lacking. One example of this is that Plesk does not support Active Directory for logins (so our students wouldn't have to create yet another ID and password for a university system). This is a fairly common request on enterprise systems, in fact here's a forum post from 2006 (!) looking for information on integrating active directory with Plesk that got zero responses. If it can be done I have found no documentation on how. We also ran into issues with creating the signup process because we couldn't put authentication on Plesk's online store. To get around that we had to create a custom form for users with a single password shared amongst the classes involved in the pilot that would allow them to choose their domain and then forward them into the Plesk store to complete the hosting signup. Even though most of it was automated, it was still not a coherent process and what should have felt like checking out at Amazon ended up generating quite a few questions from students and problems during the signup. This wouldn't be such an issue for a company like Plesk if they had robust third-party support for integrating functionality via plugins, but sadly that is not the case. While I have found a few software offerings that integrate additional functionality into Plesk, it is few and far between. The majority of support I find for panel software goes to cPanel. If you have hosted your own space in the past you might have used cPanel without knowing it. Popular hosts like Bluehost use it for their panel. cPanel has clearly made it easy for third-parties to integrate into their system, just take a look at the large application catalog on their site. There's even an iOS app for users to manage their space on the go. Migrating will likely be a large headache for us (although as it turns out cPanel will migrate you to their system from an existing service for free) but it seems worth it for the gain of having a panel with much better support, a robust environment for developing on, and much better integration with other services. Ok, enough flag waving, this is sounding like a paid post and it isn't. Hell, I might regret thinking of moving the project off of Plesk, who knows. Ultimately everyone implementing a project like this will have to come to their own conclusions and Plesk and cPanel aren't the only options out there (although they are clearly the 2 largest). Since this software is where your users will spend the majority of their time it's important that the user experience is top notch. Demo the various platforms out there and see what makes sense for you.  "Tim Owens,Building a Domain of One's Own: The Sign-Up,https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-domain-of-ones-own-the-sign-up/,1/3/2013,"We considered a lot of different options when developing the strategies for signing up for Domain of One's Own. It sounds inconsequential but in contrast to many University-run programs this project was offering something that many didn't have experience in and with first impressions being important we had to consider a lot of different scenarios. When we open it to all students would it be like you receive a gift card with your entry letter for a new domain? Would signups be tied to specific courses or programs? How would we control what could or couldn't be created on their domains? (Ok we didn't ask this, but you can bet others did!). In this post I'll talk a bit about what we envisioned, what we got for the pilot, and where we plan on going for the larger roll-out to all freshman. I'm a big fan of user experiences that seem completely natural. One thing that is advantageous for this project is that buying things online is no longer a mysterious experience. I would estimate most of our students have bought something online, whether that be an MP3, a pair of shoes from Amazon, or a Netflix account. So I wanted the signup process to mirror the aspects of what makes it easy to buy things online. Creating an account, getting a domain and hosting, and getting it all setup should be as fluid as possible. We had to start with deciding who was going to be allowed to signup during our pilot and afterwards. When we pitched the pilot project we wanted the number to be somewhere around 400 students and faculty. We also wanted it to be embedded into the curriculum of at least a few courses. I scratched out the names of faculty who I knew I could call on to work in the pilot either because they had already volunteered or I knew they ran courses that made use of technology like this already (like ds106 and Zach Whalen's Writing through Media course). So we decided we would work with a set of faculty who would run courses using these spaces. Because we have no way of identifying that a student is in a particular course during a signup (I imagine we'd have to tie in pretty closely to Banner to do something like that, which would have been a security nightmare if even possible) we created a signup form that had a single password that we distributed to all faculty involved in the pilot. Could this password be shared to others? Of course it was possible, but we decided trust was more important that heavy security at least for our first go at this. After all, if you have students itching to try and break in to be a part of your project, isn't that actually kind of awesome? We only asked students for a first and last name, email address, and to select the course they were enrolled in from a drop down menu. Once they did that they were taken to a screen that let them type in possibilities for a domain name. We prompted them to consider using part of their name, but ultimately gave them complete control. To accomplish the domain searching aspect we used the DomainsBot API which actually made it pretty simple to have a search field that would show suggestions of only available domains based on what was typed. We were even able to limit it to just the top-level domains our registrar, MediaTemple, supported (.com, .org, .net, .me, or .info). Now this is usually where we'd get the question/concern that surely this opens up a risk of a student registering UMWgirlsXXX.net or something sinister. Well sure, that's a concern I suppose. But there will always be risks when you provide opportunity, the danger is in weighing the risk much more heavily than the opportunity. Could a student use that for nefarious purposes? Yes, but they didn't. Over 200 students ran through the pilot and no one chose something inappropriate. That's not to say it won't happen, next year we could potentially have 1000 students sign up and in 4 years the whole campus will have had the opportunity. Someone will push the boundaries, it will happen. But that's a vital conversation to have with students and one we shouldn't be afraid of. The whole point of the Domain of One's Own project is not just to have students become arbiters of their own digital portfolio or web space or whatever you want to call it. We also want them to think critically about their own digital identity and how the work they do is reflected on the web and associated with them both negatively and positively. The opportunity for abuse then in my eyes is not a reason to reject the project but rather a chance to have these conversations with students and hold them accountable to the choices they make. We don't do enough of that in higher ed. After selecting their domain students were whisked off to a new page where they signed up for hosting. As I mentioned in my post about our panel software Plesk, this was less than ideal. The panel signup was not easily branded and felt like a pretty ugly online store. Although Plesk has an API it was beyond our capability to build anything for the pilot that would take the information we got from students and generate panel accounts automatically without using the online store included in their Customer and Business Manager Add-On. Once they completed the hosting signup they would receive a welcome email, have access to their panel, and once the domain was registered by MediaTemple their site would be live. For a small pilot this was completely manageable. I wasn't entirely happy with it but it worked. I've already got a few ideas for the larger rollout in the fall though that will streamline this process and would have been very useful had I known about them previously. I discovered a piece of software called WHMCS which integrates directly with Plesk and cPanel to handle signups and billing as well as domain registration. Not only could we build an ""online store"" that was branded to the rest of the site and authenticated against active directory, but we could connect eNom to this for domain registrations that would happen immediately, and it would fire off to Plesk (or more likely cPanel next year) to create hosting. In ~10 minutes not only would a student be able to walk through the entire signup process as a fluid single step, but their site would also be live immediately because the registrations are instantaneous and associated with the correct nameservers out the gate. WHMCS also has a built in knowledgebase and support ticket system that could be used for common questions and troubleshooting. There's a lot to the software and they have a lot of extensions built by third-parties to do some really interesting things. If I were building this again it would be a no brainer to start with them to handle the whole sign-up process. In my final post I plan on talking about a few other software possibilites that extend and build on the panel to make it really shine and some ideas I have for taking it even further.  "Tim Owens,"Building a Domain of One's Own: Plugins, Add-ons, and Plans",https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-domain-of-ones-own-plugins-add-ons-and-plans/,1/4/2013,"In this final post I wanted to take a look at some of the plugins and extensions that are currently out there that we're thinking of using to build a better interface for users as well as some ideas of what could make the project even better. I've mentioned quite a bit in the previous posts about how it's important that the tools we use have an open architecture that allows third-parties to build on top of it. It's so nice to find solutions to problems that maybe a small handful of people had but match up with your goals and when those people are able to pull together an extension to fix the issue rather than wait for an official supported solution from a larger corporation everyone wins. Here are just a few things I've found in the past few months that I think can nicely support the project and extend its capabilities.Installatron is a piece of software that replaces the built-in automated application solution of Plesk or cPanel. Why would you want to do that? Well, in our case while the Plesk Application Vault is nice to have, the functionality is limited in a few ways and annoying in a few others. By default an application wants to install itself in a subfolder which has led to the majority of students accidentally installing a blog at mydomain.com/wordpress instead of the root of their site. There's also no easy way to ensure these applications remain up-to-date. Installatron has a great interface and keeps an updated list of over 100 open-source applications. Admins can force updates on software installs but users can also choose to allow Installatron to keep their software up-to-date automatically either by small security release or with every major release. After testing it for a day on our server I made the decision to immediately roll this out on our install because it was so refreshing over the default application installer and the license was only $25. They also have an option to convert existing installs to their system so you don't have to run both application installers simultaneously and confuse users. Other well-known application installers to look at would be SimpleScripts and Fantastico. Handling support has always been a question mark for us. As a department primarily tasked with working with faculty to integrate technology how could we support students with such a large project as this? Certainly we could off-load that to the Helpdesk but the transfer of knowledge usually results in two departments continually bouncing tickets back and forth and the end-user suffers from increased support time. For the pilot we installed MediaWiki and set it up as a support wiki where we hosted tutorials and a few screencasts on some of the more popular scenarios that students would need training on. The advantage of a wiki like this is that using a plugin like Wiki Embed allows you to create pages on a blog that are populated by a wiki page and the links are automatically created. That's what's driving this support page which is a Wordpress page on the site feeding in the support wiki dynamically. Any information changed in the wiki would automatically be changed anywhere it is embedded. I also setup a GetSatisfaction page for support tickets but that got basically no use in the entire fall semester (most folks opt to contact via email when they run into problems). WHMCS has an option for using a knowledgebase and support ticket system that's built in to their software as well. The advantage there would be keeping track of the support requests centrally and localized to each user but I'm not convinced students and faculty would opt to use it over email as they've done in the past. Backup is another thing I'm thinking more about in the coming months. It's something that's really poorly supported by Plesk with only the option to back your site up to an FTP server or on your account (essentially duplicating the space you use). cPanel has a lot of nice backup utilities that allow for automated backups, user-initiated restorations, as well as backing up off-site to S3 storage. That last option interests me a lot because the idea of scalable storage like S3 being used for keeping all this data replicated without large costs is appealing. MediaTemple's backup service is also lacking in this regard because it requires manual snapshot backups. We have 5 rolling backups available to us but the weak link there is the requirement that I log in and initiate a backup which I rarely remember to do. In the next few months we'll be looking at better ways of automating this on the server level as well as exposing via extensions better ways for users to do their own backups and restorations. This also has the benefit of making migrations away from our server as easy as possible which is a major goal in the coming months as graduates begin to question ""what's next"" with their space (for the time being we will be renewing all pilot users for another year so nothing will expire while we continue to build this out). That last bit about migrations is a really important one. What good is a Domain of One's Own if it's just another silo for stored user content that gets lost when the student graduates? From the very beginning we've upheld the belief that by using these standard platforms we could provide an easy transition for students so that we weren't burdening them with a golden carrot that they would pay dearly for once they left the walled garden of University services (in stark contrast to the ePortfolio systems many institutions so readily adopt at a massive cost both to the institution and the student that might want to use it beyond their tenure at the school). My hope is that we can partner with a hosting company that might be interested in offering an extremely discounted rate to our students since we'll have ~1000 each year graduating with these web spaces and many will likely want to continue using them. Could we setup an architecture where we could also do this ourselves, working with the alumni department to provide a continued hosting option for years to come? That's a possibility as well. The architecture of these systems makes it easy to migrate and move the data which is the important part. Now we just have to come up with a workflow and provide those options. My hope is that in reading this series of posts if you work anywhere in the realm of education whether it be higher ed, K-12, public or private, that you're stimulated by these ideas and now believe them to no longer be beyond your grasp. As with most things that we do at UMW we've bootstrapped the building of this program in a way that's made it low cost and attainable. But most of all it's important. It's extremely important for students to navigate these spaces and understand the options that exist out there. To inspire students to build their own reflection of their online identity in a space they control and maintain rather than outsource it to Facebook, LinkedIn, or whatever comes next. It's an exciting renaissance of the web and I couldn't be more pleased with where we've gone in the pilot so far as well as where we're headed. Are you game to join us?  "Zach Whalen,A Reflection on Teaching with UMWDomains,http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/a-reflection-on-teaching-with-umwdomains/,1/6/2013,"Over the past fall and the summer semesters, I've been participating in an exciting pilot program at my university called UMW Domains (or sometimes, ""A Domain of One's Own""). The basic idea is to give students their own domain names and some webhosting, which they can then use to construct their digital identity during their time at UMW. It's an alternative to off-the-shelf eportfolio solutions, and it's a powerful way to approach digital competency, with the full rhetorical stakes of identity formation. What follows isn't intended to be a complete run down of this project. For that, read Tim Owen's blog entry from earlier last year, or some of the coverage or mentions in Wired, Inside Higher Ed, etc. Instead, what follows is a specific reflection on my own experiences.  For several years now in my Writing through Media class, I've been requiring students to purchase their own domain registration, and among its pros and cons, setting up a website on a personal domain is a process that has the power to be transformative for many people. I really believe this.  Having now completed two trial runs with the UMW Domains project, I'd like to reflect on how it went, both as a way of sharing this project with whatever my audience is and also as a way for me to think about my own pedagogy.  This class I teach is ""Writing through Media,"" ENGL 202H, what we call a ""special topics"" writing seminar. (Its current version is a descendant of the ENG 1131 I taught in grad school at Florida.) For this class, I define writing broadly to include rhetorical analysis of texts in multiple media, and I ask students to work with digital tools to produce multimedia arguments. This is a course that meets two general education requirements, so it's popular for non- majors.  The website project is a portfolio or showcase of students work through the semester, usually with a blog, and I conceive of it as a starting point for students to begin collecting and showcasing their own work to a public audience. This exposure is something new to many students, so we talk a lot about how to make responsible choices in that arena and think carefully about audience.  In the past, the domain gets established around the mid point of the semester, but with UMWDomains, I wanted to get students rolling earlier, so that by the third week, they'd all be on the same page. Despite the streamlining of the signup process by our admin, Tim Owens, most students needed some one-on-one help with me or Tim to get up and running. This one-on-one was really good, actually, but I learned some practical lessons that may help avoid some recurring challenges. I offer them here as advice to future versions of myself when I teach this again:  1: Really vet the domain names they choose. Doublecheck. Help avoid hyphens, numbers and non-permanent markers like ""umw"" in the name. Stress that this name may be a choice that follows them into professional life.  2: No subdomains. Many (most) students struggled with the basic workflow of where their files were when uploaded to the server. Subdomains are hard to explain to someone who is still working out what a domain actually is. So at all times recommend and demonstrate file paths and folder structures that are parallel to what they see on their computer.  5: Use files instead of directories for specific projects. Creating a webpage called ""/essay.html"" and including stylesheets and imagery teaches more about how webservers work and makes more sense to students than ""/essay/index.html"". Also, less risk of overriting another project or a homepage.  3: Set up a domain-specific email early on. Encouraging them to use this might help underscore the identity they're creating, as well as give them a sense of how cpanel works (or Plesk Parallels, in our case).  4: Create ways to help them find each other early and often. I did make a catch-all aggregator, but this took time and would require students to log in to read. Maybe an activity about RSS would help uptake. A class directory would be good, too, built into whatever community site or LMS we use.  These are some specific ideas. More broadly, the domain projet fit into that somewhat awkward space for this class where I'm asking students to do things digitally that they often aren't excited about doing. Most do eventually come on board, but always a handful of holdouts will insist that an English class shouldn't expect them to work with anything more complicated than a word processor. By expecting students to write HTML, I have ignored their insistence that ""I'm really not a computer person,"" because ""Computers just don't like me.""  I have to be careful to actually respect that point of view, but convince them that disengagement is not the only response to failure. At MLA this year, for example, I enjoyed hearing Kathi Inman Berens talk about her ""Innoculation Theory"" of failure: introduce failure early on and in a big way to help students start working more productively with it as a process of learning and even community building.  So for the domain project, I have to work harder to create a culture of productive failure, because really most student  ?  incoming freshman  ?  really don't have the skills or even self-awareness to truly benefit from their own URL. And furthermore, it's one thing to fail in the relative safety of the classroom  ?  it's another order of risk alltogether once you go online, as it should be.  In their final reflection papers, it was interesting to see many students echoing the admittedly utopian language I'd been using all semester to motivate them on the project. For some, they'd clearly bought into it, and I'm grateful. Many others I'm sure were telling me what they thought I wanted to hear.  My favorite reflections, though, were those students  ?  2 or 3 out of a total of 38  ?  who wrote that they'd be pulling down most of their content after the semester ended. I appreciate their honesty, first and foremost. But I also respect that the most important part of having a digital identity is choosing to have one. That's a choice with at least two options, and for some students, for various reasons, they recognized in themselves that they aren't yet ready to walk through that door. That's a choice that takes maturity, and for my part, as long as they remember where that door is, I feel like maybe I've succeeded in teaching something important.

I forgot about it until I was asked to map out how our group plans on assessing the work we do (with that line I am officially the director now) which prompted my return to that post to see what we got done. Turns out we are as awesome as I have been saying all along. I was pretty impressed with how much we accomplished, and started thinking this would be an excellent mechanism for assessment ? frame the specific projects you are working on and narrate them openly according to an ongoing examination and reflection of how they further the mission of our group, the university, and public liberal arts more generally. That seems like a meaningful mechanism of reflection and open assessment that others can chime in on, and the process can prove far less bureaucratic and much more authentic ? even if it ultimately has to be reformatted as a Word document. Anyway, that's part of what I will be working towards when re-imagining our group's assessment, but in the meantime let's take a look at what we got done last semester.  1) Bluehost Migration: A-   Four months ago I noted we had done most of the heavy lifting on this one, but there were still a few left:  > We have a few random Bluehost accounts left, but archiving all the work we've done with faculty, students and staff over the years is a major accomplishment and one I'm thrilled to almost have behind us. I'm hoping by end of September would be nothing short of awesome.  We didn't get everything off Bluehost by the end of September because the semester's rhythm took over. We are currently in the process of transferring all of UMW's Historic Preservation Bluehost to the Domain of One's Own server, and plan on getting any last accounts (I can only think of umwhistory.org at thhis point) off Bluehost by no later than this Summer. Archiving all this work has been a bit of work, but so worth it. I'll give Tim Owens an ""A"" on this one, I would have to get considerably less because I screwed up and let the umwhisp.net Bluehost account expire in December without moving all the files first ? I suck. But that still lands us at an A- because I never suck that bad!  2) Domain of One's Own: A+  Back in August we were still working out the documentation, announcement email for faculty, and sign-up details. We nailed those early on, then went on to have a pretty awesome semester fleshing this pilot project out as well as getting support from UMW's President Rick Hurley to move it from pilot into the category of a fully-funded project! Domain of One's Own goes under the epic win column.  What's more, this project has enabled DTLT to solidify our working relationship with Mary Kayler, the director for the Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation, which has been amazing. Mary did the lion's share of the work putting together an Open Dialogue about the project and we got an amazing turn out of 40-50 faculty and staff at the event, and a month later 29 faculty signed-up to be part of the pilot program we're running this Spring (more about that shortly).  Additionally, Andy Rush made an awesome video showcasing the culture of innovation at UMW that has allowed for this work to happen. Which, in turn, led to the Chronicle of Higher Education Podcast Tech Therapy featuring the project. En fuego! We have much more to do on this project, and it is anything but finished, but as of now it is extremely exciting! We've never worked with 29 faculty on a broad, conceptual project like this. It's pretty ambitious, but I think there is real excitement and enthusiasm on the part of the community to start playing in this space. It takes the idea of controlling and building your own spaces online to a new scale.  3 Makerspace: A  UMW's Makerspace, ""The Thinklab,"" had an awesome coming out semester as well. Tim Owens and George Meadows taught the Makerbots and Mashups course there, and in November there was a 24 Hour Hackathon to get the world out to faculty. Business professor Gayle Brooks used the space to get her students thinking about the implications of this technology on the future of manufacturing. What's more, UMW's Art department has their students doing the same for the implications on sculpture, design, and fashion.  The Makespace has already brought us into closer contact with the library staff in just a short 15 week span. And that relationship has only just begun given Andy Rush has done the leg work to get four brand new video work stations for students installed in the library lobby this Spring ? with a special thanks to John Morello in the Provost's Office for making it possible! Overall, between the Makerspace and our ability to get more resources for students to design, create, and build as part of their education at UMW is yet another epic win on our part. And we have only just begun to hear about the possibilities here, consider the surface only scratched. ""A"" for the Makers!  4 Online Learning Initiative (OLI): A  I'm just coming off an excellent meeting with a faculty member about her upcoming hybrid class for the Online Learning Initiative, so I am pretty excited about this as well. There are six faculty who are working with Martha Burtis, Steve Greenlaw, Mary Kayler, and myself to design and implement and online or hybrid course during the Summer or Fall 2013.  This is another project that got a commitment of funding from the administration, and we're currently trying to see if we can setup a mentorship program for faculty to build a sense of community for this project. What we realized is faculty learn a lot more from other faculty who've been through the process (a benefit of hindsight while moving through our second cohort) so with any extra funding we were considering inviting back previous participants to help mentor new faculty. So, as Martha Burtis suggested, rather than doubling up the number of faculty teaching online, spend time early on building a community of support and discourse around the practice of teaching online from values. I think this approach is in-line with how we've been imagining this project from its inception, and right now I think it's going very well.  As opposed to last semester wherein we spend time with all the faculty talking about the values, the state of online learning, various approaches, tools, etc., this semester we're gonna have to spend some serious time supporting each of the faculty members as they design their course, but that should be the fun part! To quote, L.L. Cool J: ""Hard work pays, we're getting straight on ïAs'.""  5 Distance & Blended Leaning Committee: F  Not a project but a committee that guides the conversation around online and blended learning at UMW more generally. Did we even meet this semester? I am on the committee but was off the mailing list or something. This committee all but happened without DTLT this semester, and for that I get a big, fat F (there was bound to be one). Time to reconnect with Steve Greenlaw and see what's going on with this committee.  6 President's List: A  This list referred to a series of projects from around the university that were recommended to the President to fund moving forward. They included the Digital Studies Initiative, Domain of One's Own, Online Learning Initiative, Digital Knowledge Center, Digital Repository, etc. It was an ambitious list, and we (the royal ""we"" not DTLT) did pretty well on the whole. Two projects were officially funded: Domain of One's Own and OLI. Thanks to the hard work of Jeff McCLurken and Zach Whalen, the Digital Studies Minor was approved by the curriculum committee at UMW. The Makerspace is up and running already, money can always help, but building stuff on a shoestring like DTLT has for years has always been a selling point, and sticking to that philosophy is crucial ? at least until we start ordering laser cutters ?? So, of the six projects we proposed, four are up and running, if not on their way. That's damn good!  7 SCHEV's Open Virginia Conference: ?  Back in August I wrote:  > UMW will be hosting a Digital Learning Resources conference for state institutions [in Virginia]. A committee run through SCHEV has formed and we will be putting on a conference to showcase the best teaching and learning with technology work happening around the state. The RFP is being reviewed and will be discussed in more detail shortly (it is modelled closely on Open Education call). UMW has gotten permission to host it, and we are working on getting this thing going by Spring Break 2013! I have a lot to do on this very soon, but I am excited about bringing constituents from all the state colleges and universities to have a discussion about how we can share resources.  This is all true, we have the venue, we are working on sponsorships, we have a call for papers, a registration link, and a place to submit proposals (due this Friday!) but we need more proposals and attendees! Right now we have about 100 registrations and 30 proposals in. I was hoping we would have at least 200 registrations and 60 proposals by this Friday. I'm really hoping the folks from at institutions around Virginia step-up and klick in and send folks and ideas to UMW so we can talk have a much needed discussion about how we can share resources for teaching, learning, and technology throughout Virginia. I am afraid of the grade on this one, but only time will tell.  8 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP): A  DTLT was brought into the development of the QEP at a rather late stage in the discussion. We spent much of last semester (we meaning Martha Burtis ?? ) figuring out what the parameters for the plan were, how we could help, and what our role would be. Unlike the resource framework I mentioned we would be building out in August, the QEP is actually a series of modules being created for freshman to enhance their first year experience. Not big fans of modules to begin with here at DTLT, and even lesser fans of their cost, we decided to try our hand at creating an RSA Animated video lessons for our students that we build interaction around in UMW Blogs and/or Canvas. We're still in the development stage for this pilot, but so far so good. The work is ongoing, and I think the entire committee has a much clearer idea of what we are doing and why. Although, all that said, my work on this project has been marginal at best so I may be confusing or misrepresenting some parts of it. But given the general dread leading up to this project we all felt versus the fact it has become fairly palatable by most of us now, I would give this an A.  9) Canvas: A  We are now deep into year two of Canvas. And once again, no issues to speak of. Lisa Ames has been handling this system brilliantly, and we're sailing along. You want to see our ongoing updates about Canvas? You can find them all here. I know an LMS is working really well when I don't have to worry about it ?? A  10) Media Server/Kaltura: B+  We still have a Media Server, but it is no longer running the open source version of Kaltura. Tim flipped out and killed it ?? More seriously, Tim got fed up with the open source claims on a product that simply want to up sell you to their premium package. It's bad business. DTLT isn't only about being the best edtech outfit in the world (though we are that), we are also about principles. And if including spam ads in an open source product to boost your SEO is par for the course, then we won't be playing golf with your application. Can you dig it?  That said, we are now flying without a media GUI that folks can use easily and integrates with WordPress, but we're not concerned, we are about to turn up the heat with Wowza (which we just bought a license for and installed on our Media Server) for live streaming and archiving. Next is finding a solution for uploading and embedding media from our Media Server ? never fear, we will blaze the path to media El Dorado ?? But until then, this is just very good, no excellent here just yet.   Bonus: C+  I added a bonus to my previous post that I would have UMW Blogs integrated with Active Directory by this past December. Not so much. But having said that, I didn't do it because I did some research first. After consulting with Curtiss Grymala, Luke Walter and Boone Gorges I realized I need some time to test this switchover on a dev server and really prepare for the possibilities given the potential problems with locking folks out of their sites. I heeded their advice, and this semester will start making sure we get UWM Blogs integrated with Active Directory before the first Summer Session. So, not a total fail, but not exceptional either.  That was fun, now to frame out my list for the Spring. Some of which is already here, but some of which is brand new ??  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-faculty-initiative/,2/1/2013,"I've been crazy this last month, and the proof is in the blog archive pudding: only eighteen god damned blog posts for January. I hope February proves to be a bit easier on the bava, but, with that said, January has been pretty awesome. In fact, this week seems like, to quote the oft blogging Andy Rush, ""a watershed moment in DTLT history."" Why? Well, because for the last four days four members of DTLT and Mary Kayler, of the Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation, have been running five cohorts with anywhere form 5-7 faculty talking about the details of both imagining and building their own domain. That's right, the faculty initiative of Domain of One's Own is up and running as of this week.  What's been so magical about the whole process is coming into pur offices throughout the week to groups of faculty asking questions about subdomains, digital identity, Installatron, DNS, and more! It's magic at DTLT right now, and the key is all about thinking at once conceptually and technically about the web. What's so satisfying for me, is that each and everyone of us is running our own faculty cohort and we are absolutely killing faculty development right now, 29 faculty participants from fifteen disciplines. Let me say that again, 29 faculty participants from fifteen disciplines! We rock.  Tim Owens has designed the Faculty Initiative site wherein you can see the curriculum over the next six weeks, what's more each faculty member will be setting up there own space and sharing their posts in a syndicated space for faculty's reflections on Martin Weller's The Digital Scholar (we'll be reading the entire book over the six week course) and beyond. What's more, we are all working on documenting the technical resources a faculty or student would need to get up and running with their own web host and domain.  And that idea of sharing openly what we are doing with the project and keeping in mind the possibility that others might be interested is immediately paying dividends. Emory University's Writing Program invited Tim Owens and I to participate in the inaugural Emory Symposium on Digital Publication, Undergraduate Research, and Writing. Special thanks to Marc Bousqet and David Morgen from bringing together a brilliant array of folks together from Emory as well as numerous other universities like Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, and Kennesaw State University. It was a pleasure to meet folks I've been following online through Hybrid Pedagogy, like Pete Rorabaugh (whose work is amazing and recent post about the Emory symposium along with his own explorations in this space is more than worthwhile) and Robin Wharton (who may have solved FERPA ?? ), as well as a host of new people like Rebecca Burnett (who was awesome!), Amy Goodloe, and Laura McGrath, whose remarks on Domain of One's Own marked one of the coolest moments during my short time at Emory. Namely, academics from a wide range of disciplines might possibly converge on an conceptual framework like Domain of One's Own to theorize and imagine as well as architect and build the future of the web. To quote McGrath's paper ""Remarks on the WHY of Publishing Digital Writing:""  > I'm interested in thinking about A Domain of One's Own in terms of ""a sphere of thought and action,"" to borrow my favorite definition of domain from the OED. How can we connect writing instruction, a domain as a digital ""sphere of thought and action,"" and ""opportunities to apply digital technologies to solve substantial problems common to the academic, professional, civic, and/or personal realm of their lives""?  I love this whole idea of Domain of One's Own as simultaneously a sphere of thought and action, and I really got excited to hear people not only interested in the idea, but working towards a theory of the possibilities for their respective disciplines. It's funny how I always find myself connected to the CUNY Grad Center mafia, this time with Marc Bousquet ? a thinker I greatly admire ? whose push for imagining Domain of one;s Own as central to the writing curriculum at Emory University is not only flattering for us here at UMW's DTLT, but truly invigorating. What's more, it highlights a long history of experimentation and innovation that includes many people that are no longer at UMW, namely Gardner Campbell, Chip German, Patrick, Murray-John, and Cathy Derecki. I can't fully explain how fired up we are at UMW right now! ""We're making the myths, Morrison!""  Finally, I am a huge fan of E. David Morgen. And with that I will stop ??  "Laura Moyer,At Home on the Web,http://www.umw.edu/greatminds/2013/02/11/at-home-on-the-web/,2/11/2013,"As a kid in the '90s and '00s, Haley Campbell '13 grew up with the Internet. She played computer games, learned to type from an educational software program, and experimented with blogs and fan fiction. In middle school, she tinkered with HTML coding and creating a website. As moms and dads do, Campbell's parents urged her to be safe on the Web. But they didn't discourage her interest, even if they didn't see the attraction. As Campbell puts it, ""Every generation comes up with something that the previous generation shakes their head and says, ïReally guys? Is that what you're going to do?' "" Haley Campbell uses her aetherbunny.com domain for a multitude of digital projects. But it wasn't until she got to the University of Mary Washington and enrolled in classes on new media that Campbell started thinking analytically about the Internet's potential to educate on a macro scale, and to swiftly shape and change consensus. ""It's so obvious that this was where a ton of extremely important communication was taking place,"" she said. In addition to taking classes such as digital storytelling ? called ds106 ? Campbell is among about 400 people piloting Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own initiative, which started last fall. The program, offered in collaboration with the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) and the office of Information Technology Services, provides domains and Web hosting for students and faculty. While Domain of One's Own is intentionally unstructured ? the idea is for users to define for themselves what they will present on the Web ? it encourages students to own and control their online presence. Some may use their domains strictly as e-portfolios. Others, including Campbell, take a broader approach. Campbell's aetherbunny.com domain is constantly evolving. She's used it for her digital storytelling projects; as an academic blog; as a creative outlet for short stories and poetry; and as a forum for experimenting with online editing tools. Exploring the possibilities of the Web just makes sense to Campbell. ""A lot of people take the Internet for granted. They know they have to use it, but they don't necessarily think about how they're using it,"" she said. Domain of One's Own, a nod to Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, encourages ""critical thinking about those tools."" The Web can be used badly, of course, in prefab, uninspired ways. But it also can be, she said, ""a brilliant, beautiful smorgasbord of creativity."" And it's important not to think of the Internet as a monolithic entity, she said. ""It's a massive collection of networked tools we can use and take control of if we're willing to put in the time and energy."" One example of that is what Campbell calls curating, the constant re-evaluating and editing of one's online presence. That can involve removing content, but it may more effectively entail updating existing content. For example, a college senior entering the professional world might use her personal domain to acknowledge an essay she posted as a teenager, but add a note reflecting how her views have changed. Taking that thoughtful approach through the college years can reduce seniors' anxiety that graduate schools or potential employers will turn up embarrassing teenage blogs, photos, or tweets. ""The more aggressively you prune and update your personal Web presence,"" she said, ""the more recent stuff people will find."" Tim Owens, instruction technology specialist and co-creator of Domain of One's Own, applauds Campbell's resourcefulness. ""Haley's experience of exploring and controlling her digital identity is what we want for all students at Mary Washington,"" Owens said. ""Some students may choose to continue using spaces like Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter, but the important part is that we are handing control of those choices to the students and providing them the opportunity to explore what's out there and how they can define themselves online."" Campbell gets why participating in Domain of One's Own is not required of students, and she respects that some people just aren't all that interested in crafting an online presence. But she leapt on it. ""It's like being handed this massive box of toys and being told you can play with it if you want to, but you don't have to,"" she said with a laugh. An English major with a concentration in creative writing, Campbell sees her UMW classes and Domain of One's Own opening professional opportunities. She's exploring educational technology and methods of open education such as massive open online courses, or MOOCs. She's learning ""the pedagogical aspects of it ? how teachers are teaching, and what they're teaching about."" And as an accomplished poet ? and 2013 winner of the UMW Barbara Thomas Phillips Creative Writing Scholarship ? she's evaluating the many tools writers use to find readership beyond traditional publications. She's also finding creative inspiration online, exploring new ways to use words, art, music, and online immediacy to shape narratives. But while she's part of the generation that will expand what's possible online, she hasn't lost sight of what drew her to the Web in the first place. ""Really,"" Campbell said, ""I've been telling stories on the Internet for most of my life."" "Tim Owens,Varying Degrees of Open,https://blog.timowens.io/varying-degrees-of-open/,2/13/2013,"We had a great discussion with my Domain of One's Own cohort about the uncomfortable but wonderful space it can be to be an ""open"" digital scholar. What does it mean to be open, and where do you draw the line? What's great about this cohort of faculty who are exploring their own space is that they come from a wide variety of disciplines and stages of their career. And what I learned today is just how strong the promotion and tenure track can be in influencing where and how much of one's work an academic is encouraged to publish in open online spaces. There is this odd dichotomy where academics rely heavily on the wealth of information available in online spaces to compliment their research, and yet it's a real struggle to then put that same work out in the open. What's also interesting is the distinction between publishing finished bodies of work and work in progress. While there is real value to publishing what might be considered incomplete thoughts or components of one's research in order to get feedback, there are also not only copyright concerns but also junior faculty who are actively discouraged from posting any work online that could affect their tenure and promotion track. Mary Kayler spoke of how she used to openly give out all her materials and work until one year she sat in on a session where the presenter was presenting a paper she had written, practically verbatim with slides and everything. It's a gut-punch to put yourself out there in open ways and then have that be abused. In fact I learned a new term related to sharing incomplete work: ""peeing on a tree"" where the idea is to stake a claim to an idea and present that incomplete work as work in progress (albeit still in offline ways like conference sessions) so that other academics will know your area of research and hopefully stay away. What a wild world academia can be! As we talked about how one defines how far they are willing to open themselves I was reminded of how the structure of MakerBot has changed over the past year. It was just last year around this time when MakerBot, a company that had built their entire business on the open source community and contributed heavily to that community, announced their Replicator desktop 3D printer. As with all previous models they proudly proclaimed it would be an open source product and sure enough you can download all necessary files to build one yourself on the Thingiverse. And yet later that fall the message had changed. While all previous devices would continue to be open-source (a requirement of the open source license) their newest printer, the Replicator 2 would not be, nor would the MakerWare software announced at the same time. It seemed to be a complete abandonment of the original ideals of the company and what they had stood for for so long. Naturally the community that supported MakerBot for so long was livid with a handful removing all of their files from the Thingiverse and vowing never to support the company again. In one of many blog posts Bre Pettis, the CEO of MakerBot, wrote following the outburst he talked about how difficult it is to grow their company in the face of increasing competition while still supporting the open source ideals that helped them begin. In particular he called out how companies would make identical clones of their machines and attempt to sell them to unknowing customers. With 150 employees it's obviously a much bigger challenge to figure out how ""open"" they can afford to be. He cited Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of Github, about running a company as open source as possible who wrote ""Don't open source anything that represents core business value."" For a company like SparkFun who shares much of the designs for what they sell they draw the line at their backend system, material sources, and financial data. In other words ""open"" is a moving target defined by each company and individual. And that resonates quite a bit with me when I talk with faculty. So I can't decide for a faculty member what's the right approach, they have to decide for themselves. I can only speak to my own personal experiences and wonder if there might be some correlation. In my experience, I have had very few encounters as a result of my online expression of my digital identity that were negative. By stark contrast I owe much of who I am, where I work, and the connections I've made to the open sharing I've done here on my blog, on Twitter, and as a part of online communities over the years. It is no exaggeration that the results of these encounters have changed my life for the better. I have my own limits to how much I will share online, but my default setting is open and I'm better for it. And I can't say enough how privileged I feel to be able to talk with faculty at UMW about this process and help them navigate this uncharted territory.  "Jim Groom,"Digital, Networked, Open",http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-networked-open/,2/13/2013,"As part of the faculty initiative around Domain of One's Own at UMW, there are a whole cadre of faculty blogging about there process as well as reflecting on their reading of Martin Wellerïs The Digital Scholar. We are in the third week (you can see the weekly curriculum here), and we're starting to dig deeper into both the book as well as a range of weekly technical topics that will ultimately represent a loosely compiled technical curriculum for a Domain of One's Own freshman seminar that Martha Burtis has been pitching around the office ? and something DTLT will propose this Fall for Spring 2014.  There are a ton of things to talk about in regards to the first five chapters of The Digital Scholar, but for me the ""convergence of ƒ. digital, networked, open"" in relationship to the academy and the web is what we are experimenting with UMW (44). The Domain of One's Own is very much about professors and student narrating their scholarly process online more than a brochure site, but at the same time it needs to bring one's personality into the work they do more generally. Elizabeth Wade talks about the various facets of openness in regards to Weller's work, particularly in the convergence of professional work, but also your personal life. The blurring of that line is fascinating to me, and what is compelling to me about her take on this conflation is that people become the compelling part of the equation in regards to open. Who is sharing what about themselves ? we can dismiss this as somehow less than scholarly, but at the same time I wonder if we will start to see the people behind the machinery as the most fascinating part of the whole enterprise.  I, for one, would have loved to have know more about the people I was to work with in graduate school before ever applying, or even a clearer understanding of the adjunct meat market graduate school was more generally. The whole process of becoming a scholar is premised on the personal as much as the professional, but little of that is transparent for a wide array of problematic reasons. I understand it would be impolitic for Martin to mention this in the book given his audience, but for me that is the real radical line of reasoning for open scholarship ? a clear picture of just who the people behind the ideas ideas are, and what ""such people"" represent more tangibly as human beings. To truly be a digital, networked, and open scholar means that your work and life stand as a representation of who you are and what you believe, I think this is crucial when we start to talk more generally about digital identity, and part of being authentic means being there, inhabiting this space as not only a researcher, thinker and teacher, but perhaps more importantly as a person.  "Jim Groom,Rambo Kills,http://bavatuesdays.com/rambo-kills/,2/14/2013,"The other day in our Domain of One's Own faculty initaitive cohort we were talking about embedding media in a blog, and one of the faculty pointed us to the site infogr.am, and while looking for an example to embed we came across this awesome chart of Rambo Kills mapped by those killed with and without a short on. This is the kind of data I am interested in! Analytics #4life (and death!).  Rambo kills | Infographics  "Jim Groom,It Takes a Liberal Arts Village to Raise a Digital Campus,http://bavatuesdays.com/it-takes-a-liberal-arts-village-to-raise-a-digital-campus/,2/18/2013,"UMW Daisy Chain (it takes a village to sew a giant serpent out of daisies)  UMW alum-cum-journalist Lindley Estes wrote an article today in the local Fredericksburg paper, The Free-Lance Star, about the brave new digital world emerging at UMW (forgive them the ads and video commercials, online publishing has confounded more than a few newspapers). It's pretty cool to read about a legacy of work that's been happening at UMW for almost a decade now (yes even before I was at UMW Andy, you bastard!), cast in a frame that starts to acknowledge the various ""pilot"" projects that have fomented a widespread movement on campus and beyond. From the early Bluehost experiment to UMW Blogs to ds016 to Domain of One's Own (and countless course blogs, research sites, and faculty-driven experiments in between) the UMW community is being recognized for its pioneering work in the digital arena, and that's a tremendous source of pride for all of us.  And while we all know credit is a fickle lover, it's still important to try and be clear about such things not only so that every one gets their due (which is important), but even more so to resist the urge to make any shift in the culture of UMW about a single person or thing. It's a tempting narrative (""ïHey, Sebastain Thrun, we need to fix Higher Ed in California!' said Governor Jerry Brown into the phone receiver one dark and moocy night."" Thanks for the inspiration Audrey Watters ?? ), but in the end it's not good history. And I'm not suggesting Linley Estes is doing this in her article because there is a long history of experiments in this regard, but when talking about the minting of a brand new Digital Studies minor at UMW I think it's essential to recognize that this new minor at UMW is the work of a whole host of faculty from 15 disciplines led specifically by Jeff McClurken and Zach Whalen. And, in many ways, ds106 is one part of a larger constellation of courses that breathed life into the minor.  It's important to do a roll call of faculty folks at UMW every once in a while so that we don't turn the movement into a monolith: Mara Scanlon, Leanna Giancarlo, Rosemary Jesionwoski, Marjorie Och, Nina Mikhalevsky, Karen Anewalt, Chris Foss, Gary Richards, Carole Garmon, Claudia Emerson, Mike McCarthy, Melanie Szulczewski, Jeremy LaRochelle, Betsy Lewis, Steve Gallik, Sue Fernsebner, Steve Harris, Jess Riggelhaupt, Mark Snyder, and many, many more. That's awesome, just doing the roll call. Just seeing all the faculty who have a million other things on their plate, taking the time to do the digital work that needs to be done, and doing it really well! I'm proud to watch the era of the open, connected, and digital emerge at UMW. I'm proud to be an integral part of it all. But more than anything else, I'm proud to support a faculty that's done it all pretty selflessly while DTLT (and you can read that as me) has been galavanting around the country talking about all the awesome work our faculty has been doing. It's time start sharing the credit far and wide. It takes a liberal arts village to raise a digital campus ??  "Jim Groom,Can Universities Reclaim the Web Too?,http://bavatuesdays.com/can-universities-reclaim-the-web-too/,2/20/2013,"Image credit: sevencity's ""reclaim the city""  In the chapter on ""The Public Engagement as Collateral Damage"" in Martin Wellerïs The Digital Scholar he talks about the fact that traffic to user- generated content on commercial sites is far greater than free, open content on higher education sites:  > In terms of traffic to sites, the user-generated content sites have impressive statistics: more than 100 million monthly for YouTube, 4.3 million for Scribd and 1.75 million for Slideshare (figures from http://www.compete.com for July 2010). These dwarf the statistics for most higher education projects; for instance the most well-established OER site, MIT's OpenCourseWare site (http://ocw.mit.edu), has 200,000 visitors monthly, the OU's OpenLearn 21,000 and the learning object repository MERLOT 17,000.  The argument being if you use commercial, user-generated sites like YouTube, SlideShare, Scribd, etc., the potential for your work to reach a wider audience is much greater. This is an idea I agree with (and have personally experienced through YouTube), but at the same time the lifespan of these sites is another question, one which D'Arcy Norman has been writing about intelligently since Posterous announced they are closing this April.  Even more problematic for me (again based on personal experience), is the fact that colleges and universities leave questions of fair use and copyright arbitration up to third party sites like YouTube when it comes to faculty and students critically examining media and sharing resources ? something that remains an essential role of the academy. So, when I saw the numbers of higher ed sites like MIT's Opencourseware, OpenLearn, and MERLOT I got to thinking that UMW Blogs has comparable stats to all of them on a monthly basis. Just this month we had 243,086 visits (177,069 of which were unique) and 478,462 pageviews. That's coming out of a small, fairly obscure liberal arts college that is embracing the digital, networked, and open philosophy espoused in Weller's book.  It got me thinking what institutions could do if they started approaching academic publishing platforms as collaborative, open spaces for user-generated content. What if educational institutions start reclaiming the web? If little Mary Washington can generate this kind of traffic, which is not that much less then SlideShare in the end, then what could all the public (and private for that matter) universities in Virginia do working together? I wonder if we might be approaching a moment where the vision of the digital, open, and connected Weller talks about can be supported and encouraged by educational institutions as a way of becoming hubs of open content.  What's more, as we encourage faculty and students to take ownership of theses spaces and move away from share cropping on third party sites (a lö Domain of One's Own) ? -universities should be managing sophisticated syndication networks that enable individuals to manage and control their own work but aggregates it intelligently for better search engine optimization, generative juxtaposition of content, and intelligent filtering and relational organization via tags. We have only just begun to explore the possibilities of what it would mean for institutions to own these resources and share them through free and open platforms! I AM SO FRIGGIN' EXCITED!!!  But wait ƒ. the rise of the corporate MOOC has rendered these pursuits pass ? any sense of innovation around publishing on the web has gotten lost in the hype, and elite universities are dumping their content into an LMS on steroids in a vain pursuit for raw numbers that is anything but open. A deal with the devil, BlackBoard all over again. Ah Bartleby! Ah Humanity!  All that said, I remain encouraged by Stephen Downes's assessment of a million flowers blooming in the wake of this wave of elite university MOOC madness, I'm all for optimism these days. And the fact that the MOOC crash will have served to establish open, online learning as a reality that is fundamental to every educational institution's mission from here on out might very well be the case. And if so, the approach outlined above is just a damn good head start ??  "Jim Groom,Ryan Brazell Joining UMW's DTLT in July,http://bavatuesdays.com/ryan-brazell-joining-umws-dtlt-in-july/,3/22/2013,"It is my distinct pleasure and honor to announce that UMW has officially hired Ryan Brazell as UMW's newest Instructional Technology Specialist for the Humanities. He will be starting at the University in July, and we are unbelievably excited about the prospect of brining in such a uniquely qualified candidate to further bolster the awesome that is DTLT. Ryan has had extensive experience in instructional technology over the last eight years at both Oberlin College and the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, he's experimented wildly with applications like WordPress ? a platform we love at DTLT ? for creating portfolios (something that'll be key for the Domain of One's Own project we're unleashing camus-wide in Fall). I am glad Ryan seems excited about the prospect because he's going to have some of the best faculty in the country to partner with to frame a whole new vision for what ed tech means to the liberal arts.  And while I could go on for years about why Ryan is perfect for this position, let me focus on one thing in particular that really excites me about the prospect of working alongside Ryan: the humanity he brings to this postion. A vision of people as the essence of what it is we ""augment"" through our experimentation with technology. This is the vision we hope to cultivate at DTLT as a group specifically, and what UMW wants to cultivate more broadly. It's at the heart of a small, residential liberal arts experience. The following quote is by Ryan on the Oberlin ethos (he's a proud Yeoman!), which is currently adorning that College's brilliant new homepage, makes the point far better than I ever could:  > It's about refusing to put ANYONE into a box, regardless of what they may appear to be on the surface. It's about treating others with dignity, and kindness, and respect, regardless of whether you agree with or even understand another's point of view.  Yeah, I can dig that, though no one can ever accuse me of it ?? I guess I have to finally pay that damn finders fee to Barbara Sawhill for bringing Ryan to Faculty Academy back in 2008 after all! DTLT is approaching warp speed right now, people, hold on tight, things just got that much better when Ryan agreed to come to come work for DTLT and unleash his genius on UMW!  "Tim Owens,Building a Syndication Framework for the Domain of One's Own,https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-syndication-framework-for-the-domain-of-ones-own/,3/24/2013,"I have to admit I feel a little bit like an amateur cook that has a lot of really fancy ingredients in front of him and no idea how to make them sing. I've been playing with a lot of different tools lately and they all seem very powerful in their own way. And yet for my specific need I can't seem to put them together in a way that works, yet. I figured it wouldn't hurt to put all this into a blog post and shop it around to people much smarter than I am for further insight. I'll break it down into three sections: The Scenario, The Tools, and The Duct Tape.  ### the Scenario  We are currently running a pilot of almost 400 students and faculty who have their own domains and web hosting. This fall we'll open it up to all incoming students and every year after that we'll do the same. Each user can have unlimited subdomains and install any LAMP-based software on there they want (most choose Wordpress but they're certainly not limited to that). We want to create a central site that feeds in content from all of these various web properties into a single source that can be broken down by categories. We could then take category feeds and push them out to other properties. This means having a History department highlight the work they're students are doing is as simple as aggregating a categorized feed of that work. We could break it down by course, discipline, semester, year, faculty member, etc. We are already able to do this using UMW Blogs because everyone is on the same system and it's all Wordpress so a Tags Blog is simple. In this case there are a lot of unknowns (Did they create a subdomain? What did they install? What's the RSS feed for the site?) that make automation a lot trickier, but I've got a few tools and options I've been banging around and though I'm not successful yet I think everything is there. ### The tools  FeedWordpress - A plugin that we use quite often in DTLT for aggregation. Grabs a bunch of feeds and brings those feeds in as actual posts on the blog. It can also bring in and create categories from the sites and sites can have specific categories or authors applied to them. Problem: A lot of this stuff is manual work. You can hand it a list of sites but it's still going to have you manually choosing feeds from an autodiscovered list and any new feeds means you're back in the FWP admin area. FWP seems ideal for the last leg of the framework since Wordpress does RSS feeds for categories so well and FWP does a great job of syndicating, but the automation piece needs to be figured out. Installatron - I mentioned that due to the nature of the Domain of One's Own project we don't always know where people are installing these websites. That's only partly true. If someone creates a subdomain and uploads a set of files pointing to a database they created we won't have any idea it exists without constant monitoring. But the good news is the vast majority install web-based software using the automated tool we implemented called Installatron. And Installatron has an API that will spit out a list of installations including everything you ever wanted to know about that installation. I've only briefly played with this and got a JSON-formatted document with everything installed on the server. Ideally what I'd want from this is a hook that writes specific information from the available data to a separate file (probably an OPML file) every time a new install is created. There are customization hooks where I can do various things when an install happens so that's likely the best place to start. Information on their API is available here. SimplePie - Started looking at this today because of another tool, Moonmoon, that uses it as a backend. It does feed discovery and aggregation of multiple sites. I don't know enough about it but their documentation seems pretty good. Yahoo Pipes - I get a bit weary about using Pipes for critical glue like this because ultimately it's owned by Yahoo and nothing is sacred there, but there's not doubt it could be useful for massaging the content of various sources into the right formats. ### The Duct Tape  Back in the fall I wrote about some of these ideas and even pulled together an aggregate blog that was feeding in most of the fall semester work. But as I've outlined here it was a manual process using FWP and pasting in a long list of sites. With most students opting to use subdomains these days it makes that process even more difficult. I'm imagining some combination of the tools above could be hacked together to give us what we want. Ideally the less duct tape involved the better, but as long as we're using solid tools I'm not afraid of daisy-chaining multiple processes together to get the desired output. So as is probably quite obvious at this point I have almost no idea what I'm doing and rather than bang my head against the problem for months on end I figured it couldn't hurt to outline my goals and ideas here in the hopes that someone may have some ideas. Help me Obi Wan!  "Tim Owens,Unified Syndication of a Domain of One's Own,https://blog.timowens.io/unified-syndication-of-a-domain-of-ones-own/,3/26/2013,"In my last post I outlined a bit of what our vision is for syndicating all of the work happening in disaggregate spaces through Domain of One's Own. When you use Wordpress Multisite it's pretty easy to get a unified feed of all the work that is happening since everything is in your database and can be called pretty easily alongside approaches like Sitewide Tags. With our new setup on UMW Domains each individual has their own self-hosted Wordpress install in their own space. In fact many have 2-3 installs in a variety of subdomains, and it's not even guaranteed that they're using Wordpress (although the majority do). So how can we syndicate all that work into a central hub that could allow us to parse that data by a variety of factors like course, category/tag, content type, etc? I spent the last two days hacking away at this and I've got the first step to a solution. The two tools we're using are Installatron and FeedWordpress. Installatron is a plugin that runs on our hosting software, Plesk (but we'll be switching to cPanel this year and Installatron supports that as well), and provides an extremely user-friendly interface for installing web software. No FTP uploads or setting up databases, in most cases it's one-click, enter a few settings, done. While there's no way to know for sure without writing a fancy script, I'd estimate the vast majority (maybe even all) of the installs of Wordpress are done using this tool. And of course FeedWordpress is always playing a star role in our syndication efforts. It pulls in any number of feeds along with all their categories/tags (as well as any predefined by you) and creates a local post that points back to the source. For setting up a unified ""mother blog"" that can then have RSS feeds based on any category or tag it's still the best thing going. What I didn't know when outlining my ideas a few days ago was that Installatron had some really fancy ways of writing scripts that would initiate at various points during the install or upgrade process of piece of software. You can get as granular as writing a script that only runs for a specific version of a specific piece of software and choose where in the process of install it gets run. Once I found out from them that connecting to an external database via PDO would work, I knew I could build the glue that would insert information from that install into our feed website's database in a format that FeedWordpress would use to parse it. Information on customizing Installatron can be found here and I have to say their support is FANTASTIC with ticket responses sometimes coming within minutes of asking the question. Below is the code I ended up using:  class iinstallercustomcode  {  function init() { $this->registerCustomCode(""wordpress"", ""all"", ""install"", ""last"", ""process"", ""wordpressinstall""); }             function wordpressinstall($o)            {                    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=wordpressf1', 'wordpress08', '2jWz3tP6E');                    $siteurl = $o->install->ini[""url""];                    $feedurl = $siteurl . '/feed/';                    $linkinsert = ""INSERT INTO `wplinks` (`linkid`, `linkurl`, `linkname`, `linkimage`, `linktarget`, `linkdescription`, `linkvisible`, `linkowner`, `linkrating`, `linkupdated`, `linkrel`, `linknotes`, `linkrss`) VALUES     (null, '$siteurl', '$siteurl', '', '', '', 'Y', 1, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '$feedurl')"";                    $db->query($linkinsert);                    $linkid = $db->lastInsertId();                    $setcat = ""INSERT INTO `wptermrelationships` (`objectid`, `termtaxonomyid`, `termorder`) VALUES     ($linkid, 3, 0)"";                    $db->query($setcat);            }     }     ?>  So basically what is happening there is a function is initialized that will run on all versions of Wordpress that get installed. The function sets up a connection to our mother blog's database where we want to do the feeding. We grab the URL from the install and write it to a variable as well as format an RSS URL by tacking /feed/ to the end of the URL. Then we format the SQL query to add a new link to the wplinks table which FeedWordpress uses as the source of what gets syndicated. FeedWordpress has to have the link be assigned a specific category which unfortunately is setup in the wptermrelationships table so after putting our link in we have to grab the unique ID of the link of format a new query that adds a term relationship between that link id and the assigned category (in this case category 3 which is ""Contributor"") and fire off that query. The result is that any new Wordpress install now automatically gets added to FeedWordpress on our feed website here and begins syndicating automatically. This in and of itself is pretty awesome. It means any course using UMW Domains could now ask their students to use a specific tag and then grab a feed of that tag from the mother blog. The students don't have to add their sites to any main website or do anything else other than the simple act of installing Wordpress. But we can go further by allowing students to set certain categories during the install process. With Installatron we can setup custom input fields in the install page that will ask for specific information. In this case we could have a list of checkboxes and ask the student/faculty member to ""check all that apply"" and have them categorize that install by whether their a student, faculty member, what discipline they're in, etc. All those checkboxes can be associated with categories that get inserted into the SQL query that adds the link so FeedWordpress will automatically assign those categories to the feed in addition to any categories the user sets on their individual posts. I could give the History departement a feed of all the work their student's are doing on UMW Domains as a feed that they could pull into their department website to highlight that work. This isn't limited to Wordpress either. We have the framework in place now where I can go through some of the other install processes like Drupal and setup the same link insertion. The only variable that changes is the format of the RSS URL which is easy enough to find. There are tons of possibilities and I'm only covering the low hanging fruit here that we've been talking about for years and doing on UMW Blogs but can now do across the beautiful but disaggregated spaces that UMW Domains provides. It's a small single-run batch of eduglu that's starting to smell pretty potent.  "Jim Groom,A Domain of One's Own to Community Syndication Hubs,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-to-community-syndication-hubs/,4/2/2013,"I will be heading up to Boston this weekend thanks to Philipp Schmidt and Claudia Caro Sullivan who are hosting an open learning hackathon at MIT. Below is the proposal I submitted for an idea I would like to pursue conceptually and actually ? what do you think? Tim Owens has already been working at some of this with Installatron, and I wonder if there is a better time than now to start figuring out how you create a community out of a variety of distributed, loosely connected domains.  > How do we start thinking of information architecture that allows students and faculty to control their work (a la UMW's Domain of One's Own) and feed it cleanly into a distributed campus publishing environment? I hope to talk and work with people around an idea of revisiting and framing a suite of tools that might be bundled (like Commons-in-a-Box) to make syndication hubs for online courses, communities, and even institutions that much more porous, open, and affordable. A perect example of this can be seen in ds106 or Alec Couros' etmooc, thanks to the work of Martha Burtis and Alan Levine.  >  > What's more, I think the time is right to examine what it might mean if universities invest in open frameworks that they can customize and share as part of designing learning environments that meet the needs of a wide range of schools that are experimenting with digitally enhanced, hybrid, and online learning as a result of the recent push towards exploring these spaces. I still think their is gold in the hills of Jon Udell's ongoing vision of a loosely coupled web of professional identities that we can link together and make discoverable as an engaged communities through aggregation, and I want to see if I am alone or not.  Now what say you?  Update: I was totally remiss in my first go round for not mentioning the recent, awesome work martin Hawksey is doing with syndication, aggregation, and a syndication-driven MOOC platform. He deserves a lot of credit for getting us that much closer!  > Just realized how remiss I am for not mentioning @mhawkseyïs amazing work with WP as course hub recently mashe.hawksey.info/2013/03/mooc-iƒ will fix now  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) April 2, 2013  "Jim Groom,The Awareness Network: the Web as Context Engine and the Issue of Coherence,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-awareness-network-the-web-as-context-engine/,4/5/2013,"While preparing the Domain of One's Own/Open Educational Experiences talk I've given at SUNY's Open Learn, ACCS, and THE Ohio State's innovateOSu conference I listened to two talks and one IT Conversations interview by Jon Udell. More specifically, I spent the 7 1/2 hour drives to both Syracuse, NY and Columbus, OH listening again and again to ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology"" in early 2007, his conversation with Rohit Khare from UC Irvine about syndication frameworks in Fall 2007, and a talk he gave at the Kynetix conference in 2010 called ""Architectures of Context."" I listened to these three in that order because it helps me map some of the larger, conceptual visions of the aggregation/syndication bus as both a shift in the culture of sharing online as well as a technical innovation. It's taken me too long a time to realize just how brilliant Gardner Campbell's alignment with Jon Udell's thinking was early on in 2005 for highered, but I remain eternally grateful.  I think one of the things I am learning from Udell's talks and discussions is how he is constantly trying to explain and re-explain his ideas using new metaphors, stories, and examples. He's all class, his examples are richly complex, and the work he has been painstakingly doing over the last decade or more to help people understand that the web is first and foremost a collaboration engine predicated on heretofore unimaginable scales of both awareness and context is truly powerful, and brilliantly pares down the power of the web. What's more, Gardner Campbell has picked up this thread in his own blog recently, which has been on fire, taking the time to differentiate the web from the internet:  > The Internet transmits information. The Web enables (stimulates, encourages) a set of connections that, from the first link to the enormous set of links we now experience, symbolize ideas about relationship.  The web provides context through relationships and builds a distributed sense of awareness that through the basic power of linking (not only in terms of an href, but in terms of linking ideas, people, and possibilities). I love this frame, and one of the points Jon Udell was making in his ""Disruptive Nature of Technology"" talk back in 2007 that I find really pwoerful in this regard was that Web 2.0 was not so much an evolution of the web as it was a reclaiming of the web to the read/write medium in had originally been imagined as. Here is a quote from Udell's 1999 Practical Internet Groupware (I've also been reading that!) which is actually just an earlier version of Udell's quote from the 2007 talk:  > The inventors of the World Wide Web were scientists who wanted a better way to collaborate with far-flung colleagues. The intended HTTP to work as a read/write protocol. Users of the web wouldn;t just consume hypertextual content, they would also contribute and aggregate it. As the web went mainstraim, though, it became more like television than groupware. (34)  If collaboration and context is the foundation of the web, than how do we start imagining that for education and beyond. I feel like the work I have been doing over the last seven years has been reclaiming education for the web, making the process of teaching and learning visible, at the same time building ""groupware"" that aggregates this process and makes it discoverable. This is exactly what I want to keep pushing with the syndication framework I'll be discussing today at MIT (and which I quickly framed here a couple of days ago). For me, the Rohit Khare discussion (which I understand conceptually, though struggle to some degree with technically) frames the fact that what syndication and aggregation provide us is not dissimilar from the affordances a system like Facebook or Twitter provide, the difference being, at least for me, there is a way to control and own your words if you maintain your own domain. This is why the vision of Diaspora was interesting a couple of years ago, but also why Alan Levine's vision that social spaces online like Twitter, Flickr, etc. are important for congregating still resonates.  The completely distributed, independent model has its issues, but the biggest issue ? and this is what Udell frames brilliantly in the Kynetix talk, is an issue of coherence online. How do we allow people to both own their words and also have a coherence that frames them within an academic community like UMW? This is what syndication and aggregation can solve seamlessly, and it's the thing I want to see the syndication bus deal with, i.e. the issue of online coherence for one's sense of identity, a space that helps us contextualize what we do in the academic context as part of a larger community. The challenges of Udell's practical internet groupware still face us today, and the solutions are still practical, relatively cheap, and seem to look a lot like the web.  "Jim Groom,Reclaim Open Learning,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/,4/11/2013,"Reclaim Open Learning ? Not Anti-MOOC. But pro open. from J?ran und Konsorten on Vimeo.  This past weekend I had the real privilege of going to MIT's Media Lab to join a group of diverse international thinkers for a hackathon around the idea of learning on the open web thanks to Philipp Schmidt ? I can't believe he still has faith in me, does anyone any more? The theme that emerged is reclaim, as in reclaim the web, reclaim your data, reclaim open learning, etc. This is a topic very much in line with (and at least for me inspired by) Boone Gorges and D'Arcy Normanïs Reclaim Project. The theme of ""reclaiming"" the digital bits of one's online self is an interesting one, and I like how it conceptually dovetails with the work UMW is doing with Domain of One's Own. Even more than that, I like how it might be taken as a call for people to take an active part in considering and reclaiming their own stuff on the web. No need for a manifesto, the process and thinking behind it is actually pretty practical, relevant, and extremely important. What's more, it requires us all to learn and share along the way to make it matter. Therein lies the communal vision around such an idea, the emergence of affinity networks of people who more and more feel that controlling some part of themselves on the web might be important (Audrey Watters made this last point brilliantly in the video above).  And while I have to write a longer post (or ten) about my thinking, I can't right now given my headspace ? and probably won't any time soon. So, in the meantime, I want to quickly note that my small piece of the weekend at the MIT Media Lab was working with the very awesome Kin Lane, the ""API (and IPA) Evangelist,"" who many, many people need to get on their radar because his thinking and execution in this space is nothing short of brilliant (and he keeps good company too ?? ). He is working this stuff out on a conceptual level for the federal government's digital strategy using open APIs, and it is remarkable how much our visions of this stuff align as an approach to the web. He worked with me on hacking out a wizard for what a ""Reclaim Your Domain"" project might look like. A big part of it is helping people get up and running with their own domain, and use some contextual help within the wizard to get at explaining the thinking around why and how (for us ease of use, explanation, and design are all equally crucial).  This is, in part, based on the immediate needs of UMW for our Domain of One's Own project launching in the Fall, but what was essential about the Reclaim Your Domain project was that it needs to abstract itself out beyond UMW's vision (which can often be simplified to ""install your blog"") and Kin and Audrey were awesome in pushing this aspect. Reclaim Your Domain has to be about a variety of hosting options, services, resources, and possibilities to manage your identities online across a variety of services, this is not necessarily ""give up all social networks, drop offline, and feed the rabbits""  ? rather it's about controlling (to the extent you can), backing up, and syndicating the work you do on the web. A home for your data that can be as distributed and decentralized as the platform it's designed for. What's more, we will be using PubSubHub as a hook to establish more sophisticated directories of feeds across services for a given community that signs up through a wizard that also can start aggregating much more than just blog posts (think images, videos, etc.).  Reclaim Your Domain also builds on the amazing recent work Martin Hawksey's been doing with designing a (M)OOC with open source software that is light, relatively easy, and freely available. The way we were talking about it, a version of Hawksey's open courseware would be an option in the resources part of the wizard to allow any domain (or node) to also become a hub by installing a push-button (M)OOC-in-a-Box (which can also become its own hub) or push a button and have a ds106 framework, Commons-in-a-Box, etc, and a community there to support you as well. How sick would that be? And with the possibilities of collaboratively creating, coding, and forking on GitHub, we could actually manage all this well. Think about it, a service that actually empowered people to experiment with various technologies created within a specific context on their own domain for the price of a url and cheap hosting ? this is UMW's BlueHost experiment writ large, and it has legs.  Given I will be offline for the next month or more, I spent a bit of time today sharing with Martha Burtis and Tim Owens as much as I can of my weekend at MIT and my take on the project to carry on the work with Kin Lane, Audrey Watters, and Philipp Schmidt so that we can push the Reclaim Your Domain project (and its various possibilities) forward to a larger community of folks. UMW obviously has a vested interest in this, but it makes sense that we make the frame for Reclaim Your Domain as accessible to as many people as we possibly can. So I hope you will join us in this endeavor. I believe Kin Lane is putting the project on GitHub, which will be one place to get involved, and I also imagine Audrey (whose blog even challenges the bava for greatness [cue meek sniveling] ""#nobody?"") will frame this out far more articulately than I ever could.  As for the Open Learning Hackathon at MIT, it was a complete blast. I want to give a shout out to everyone there over the weekend, Tara Tiger Brown, Ari Bader Natal, The GERMANS! (Friederike, Adrian, J?ran), Mimi Ito, Dirk Cuys, Vanessa Genarelli, Emily Zeamer, and David Theo Goldberg that made the weekend truly inspiring. And, I would be remiss if I didn't note how awesome it was to connect with Jonathan Worth, whose work with open teaching and learning demonstrated in classes like #picbod and #phonar is mind blowing and remains an inspiration. Thank you all for a great weekend.  "Leslie Madsen-Brooks,Beyond Disruption: Higher Ed Innovation from Within,https://thebluereview.org/beyond-disruption/,5/7/2013,"I've heard that higher ed needs to be ""disrupted"" because it's not cost efficient, it treats students as learners rather than customers, it's risk- averse and unproductive, it values research over teaching, it doesn't offer enough flexibility to adult learners, it's too focused on prestige and credit hours instead of broad-based student competencies, it's done a lousy job of using technology to expand affordable access to degrees, faculty spend too much classroom time lecturing and faculty act as if we should be exempt from the sweeping technological change that has upended the newspaper and music industries.  TBR Blog is a space for commentary, opinion and reports on research in progress.   I'm not opposed to disruption; rather, I'm skeptical about the kind of disruption start-ups and tech folks promise: ""paradigm-shifting"" technology that improves university teaching and learning. The truth is, many of these start-ups clearly have no idea what actually works in higher ed and know little about the direction university teaching and learning have moved in the last 10 years, because they're trying to take us backward, not forward. Start- up and commercial tech are certainly proving disruptive ? just in all the wrong ways.  But this is a not (merely) a post complaining about bad technology. Instead I want to highlight the ways university faculty and staff are driving thoughtful technological innovation. These are people who intimately understand students' needs and the faculty's interests, tech skills and psychology. And although there are some acclaimed universities launching projects with the aim of spawning start-ups or transferring commercial technology to industry, I want to showcase a few projects that take the opposite track: they're innovative, but they tend to rely on open source technologies, and their focus is on individual and collective empowerment of students and communities, rather than commercialization.  Those who have been paying attention only to partnerships among Silicon Valley companies and the Ivies may be surprised that the beating heart of a tremendous amount of academic technology innovation is a small state university in Fredericksburg, Virginia. At the University of Mary Washington, the Division of Teaching and Learning Technology has launched at least four amazing initiatives that should be replicated widely because it's clear to even casual observers that they advance teaching and learning in myriad ways. For one, evidence of student learning appears on the open web, and I encourage you to check out the current blogs developed for courses. Faculty, too ? and I know this from first-hand experience ? benefit from knowing what students are thinking (as expressed in blog posts and comments) before they convene for class.  Several years ago, UMW's DTLT premiered UMW Blogs, termed ""the Bluehost experiment"" by the DTLT staff because in its first iteration, it was little more than a WordPress Multi-User installation on an inexpensive ($6.95 per month) shared server at Bluehost. Today, any UMW student, faculty, or staff can set up a blog for class or personal use on UMW Blogs ? and 500 courses have been brought onto the platform since fall 2008. Anyone can browse the courses using UMW Blogs or discover all kinds of non-course blogs by exploring the latest posts featured on the home page. The UMW archives, for example, recently put online a series of lectures by the late civil rights leader James Farmer, and Jess Rigelhaupt's Oral History class has created Rosie the Riveter, an excellent resource that includes ""firsthand accounts of what people experienced on the American home front during World War II.""  Next to emerge from this innovation engine was DS 106, an open course on digital storytelling, originally taught by Jim Groom, but since taught by several different instructors, including noted ed tech thought leaders and innovators Martha Burtis and Alan Levine, and recently by instructors at other universities as well. Because of the strong networks of the instructors and students, DS 106 took on a life of its own, with students ? both those enrolled at UMW and those following the course from elsewhere ? providing daily fun assignments (""the Daily Create"") that stimulate participants' creativity and stretch their technological savvy. DS 106 spawned ds106 radio, a free-form, streaming broadcast for which anyone could volunteer to provide content. How popular is DS 106 and its apparently endless stream of creative multimedia content? In spring 2012, Groom launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a better web server for DS 106, and the campaign raised 600% of its goal in just a few days, providing funding for all kinds of course improvements and expansions. While Kickstarter provided private funds for this project, I'm excited about this kind of crowdsourced funding ? although I'd be even more enthusiastic about greater public funding ? because it allows project creators greater future freedom than would, say, funding from investors whose motive is more likely to be profit than pedagogical revolution.  Springing next from the mind of the DTLT geniuses was Domain of One's Own, in which each first-year student at UMW receives a domain name and space on a web server. The project encourages each student to ""reclaim the web"" by ""taking control of your digital identity,"" gathering its artifacts ""in a central place that you own and control."" And it's offered in collaboration with the university's Office of Information Technology Services:  > The pilot gave 400 students and faculty their own domain name and web space to install a portfolio of work or map onto existing systems. In Fall of 2013 every incoming student at UMW will have the opportunity to choose their own domain and receive a web hosting account with the freedom to create subdomains, install any LAMP-compatible software, setup databases, email addresses and carve out their own space on the web that they own and control.  Then, as if granting students this creative freedom and technical autonomy wasn't enough, this spring UMW launched Thinklab, a makerspace. According to its About page:  > ThinkLab is the exciting new makerspace located in the Simpson Library at the University of Mary Washington. As a collaboration between the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies, the College of Education, and the Library, ThinkLab hosts a variety of emerging technologies and tools for students and faculty across all disciplines. 3D printing, robotics, and electronics work using Arduinos and simple breadboard kits are just some of the many exciting things happening at ThinkLab.  The innovations and ? yes, I'll say it ? disruptions, emerging from UMW exemplify some of the best practices in developing communities of learners, fostering collaboration, encouraging writing and reflection and developing curiosity about the world. Channeling George Kuh, Randall Bass emphasizes that such ""high-impact practices"" lead to ""meaningful learning gains"" as well as ""high retention and persistence rates"" because they encourage these specific behaviors:     Investing time and effort    Interacting with faculty and peers about substantive matters    Experiencing diversity    Responding to more frequent feedback    Reflecting and integrating learning    Discovering relevance of learning through real-world application  In an age when universities are pushing faculty ever harder to develop monetizable intellectual property, it's refreshing to see faculty doubling down on using relatively inexpensive technologies to improve student learning. UMW is a case in point: it's a modestly funded, small state university that, thanks to all the active minds (and periodic strategic hires) at DTLT and on the faculty, has become a major hub of innovation in higher education. It joins other cutting-edge departments and programs launched by other Virginia institutions, including the University of Virginia's Scholars' Lab and the Virginia Center for Digital History, as well as George Mason University's Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, whose staff and fellows have created not only a lot of terrific curricular resources, but also Zotero, Omeka, ScholarPress, PressForward, and the globally popular THATCamp. It's amazing how much scholars, programmers and others have accomplished in such a short time ? and all without spinning off start-ups as seems to be so fashionable in higher education today.  This is the kind of disruption I'd like to see at more universities, especially out here in the Intermountain West, Pacific Northwest and Great Basin. That's going to be difficult because, in Idaho at least, we aren't developing or attracting people with the programming training to do this kind of work. Still, we can go a long way using inexpensive but high-quality, open- source tools. And in fact, in my teaching, I have relied on a number of open- source tools, including WordPress and LocalWiki, and (to a lesser extent) Sakai, an increasingly robust alternative to the unwieldy course management system Blackboard. I require my students to create digital products and imagine new digital services they might provide, and I teach them about Creative Commons and the public domain.  I admit I feel a good deal of pride that this movement toward open source, open access learning founded on creative uses of inexpensive technologies is driven by digital humanists, faculty, librarians and academic technologists ? including some people who manage to occupy all of those fields simultaneously. If you follow any of these innovators on Twitter or read their blogs, you can see their conversations and collaborations unfold, illustrating, as Scott Leslie points out, that disruption emerges from networks that enable open learning. Their collaborations and projects are excellent case studies of why Jon Boeckenstedt's term ""punctuated equilibrium"" makes more sense than ""disruption"" when discussing changes in the digital landscape of higher ed.  I'm no detractor of entrepreneurship; I encourage my public history graduate students to make their own way in the world, and if I wasn't so busy with my faculty responsibilities, I'd dabble in it myself. But what if, instead of investing so much time, effort and money in start-ups, MOOCs, lecture capture, unwieldy learning management systems, overzealous intellectual property protections and the like, we redoubled our efforts in open access, open learning and open source? These are the efforts that would prove truly disruptive of business-as-usual at the university.  Of course, I'm not the only one thinking along these lines. Aaron Bady muses on what makes a good MOOC (hint: it's open and free), and then points out that what most folks are talking about when they invoke ""disruption"" is a further corporatization of the university:  > So I want to shift the debate a bit. [Clay] Shirky thinks in terms of ""disruption"" and what can come of it, in theory. I think in terms of what the ""disruption"" of the University of California system looks like in practice, as a complex of politicians, financiers, and career administrators move in lock- step to transform it into a self-sufficient corporate entity, and to enrich private industry in the bargain. I see a group of decision-makers who quite manifestly do not know what they are talking about and who barely try to disguise it, for whom ""online"" is code word for privatization. If I am against MOOC's, I am against the way ""MOOC"" is being experienced in California, in practice: as an excuse to cheapen education and free the state budget from its responsibility to educate its citizenry.  There's little need to hire Udacity or Coursera or any other ed tech company to disrupt higher education because faculty and staff representing key nodes in the network are already evolving the theory and practice of teaching, learning, research and outreach in ways that are incredibly productive, if not always recognized. Take a moment to explore some of the projects and networks I've discussed here and then ask yourself: who exactly is so invested in interrupting this productive disruption, and why? Why are universities considering spending $2 million to affiliate with a MOOC provider, when tremendous faculty creativity and the $6.95 Bluehost experiment are at hand?

Writers Talk (@WritersTalk) May 8, 2013  Back in March I gave a keynote presentation at THE Ohio University's InnovateOSU conference (which I documented here) framing the various experimentations at UMW that led up to our current Domain of One's Own project. The day before that presentation I was fortunate enough to sit down with the remarkable Jonathan Diehl, an OSU student that does his university proud. [N.B. ? Jonathan doesn't have a domain of his own I can link to so I will settle for his twitter ?? ] I had a compelling and wide-ranging discussion with Jonathan, and what I really loved about talking with him was the fact he had done is research quite thoroughly. He knew about and read this blog; he was familiar with EDUPUNK; he researched ds106; and, he even had a working knowledge of Domain of One's Own. Unlike many ""professionals"" I have talked with over the years, John did his homework before this interview and there is no question what a huge difference that made in the tenor and depth of a conversation.  The half-hour conversation had a very specific arc that I think worked quite well. Here are the topics we covered (I think in this order):     how I rediscovered writing through blogging?    what the hell is EDUPUNK?!    how did EDUPUNK morph into ds106?    is ds106 a MOOC?;    what might the technical architecture of learning look like in the future?    what exactly is a MOOC and what might it mean for the future of higher ed?    and, finally, how might platforms (and communities) unlock passion?  The above topic list was created by me post-facto, so it may not be entirely accurate ? consider yourself warned. Also, listening to the conversation again I was struck by how much work I have to do on clarifying my thoughts about the technical architecture of the future of learning, I found my description and examples far too broad and vague. What's more, the ideas around the open architecture of the future of personalized learning is something I have been spending a lot of time thinking about recently. So listening to this conversation has been very useful in forcing me to clarify my thoughts in preparation for a presentation I'll be giving May 16th at the Campus Technology Virtual Leadership Summit (moderated by none other than Gardner Campbell). My talk for the Campus Technology event is inspired by Jon Udellïs 2007 ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology"" talk (as well as his IT Conversation with Rohit Khare and his 2010 Kynetx Keynote) as a means to think about how a technical architecture for education is better driven by coherence and context rather than scale and broadcasting, but more on that shortly. In the mean time, I'd like to give another thank you to Jonathan Diehl for being an amazing interlocutor, and tolerating the fact I talk too damn much!  OSU Writers Talk  "Jim Groom,"UMW's Innovation isn't Technical, it's Narrative",http://bavatuesdays.com/umws-innovation-isnt-technical-its-narrative/,5/9/2013,"When someone as sharp as Leslie Madsen-Brooks writes an article about the state of innovation in higher education and points to UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (a.k.a DTLT) as the example, I can't help but feel pretty good about my life (as I imagine other DTLTers might). I mean quotes like the following reinforce the constant boasting I do in the office to anyone who will listen ??  > Those who have been paying attention only to partnerships among Silicon Valley companies and the Ivies may be surprised that the beating heart of a tremendous amount of academic technology innovation is a small state university in Fredericksburg, Virginia. At theUniversity of Mary Washington, the Division of Teaching and Learning Technology has launched at least four amazing initiatives [UMW Blogs, ds106, Domain of One's Own, and the ThinkLab] that should be replicated widely because it's clear to even casual observers that they advance teaching and learning in myriad ways.  Orƒ.  > The innovations and ? yes, I'll say it ? disruptions, emerging from UMW exemplify some of the best practices in developing communities of learners, fostering collaboration, encouraging writing and reflection and developing curiosity about the world.  Andƒ  > In an age when universities are pushing faculty ever harder to develop monetizable intellectual property, it's refreshing to see faculty doubling down on using relatively inexpensive technologies to improve student learning. UMW is a case in point: it's a modestly funded, small state university that, thanks to all the active minds (and periodic strategic hires) at DTLT and on the faculty, has become a major hub of innovation in higher education.  I'm verklempt! ?? It's awesome to see the innovative work happening at UMW for almost a decade now get recognized more broadly. Leslie's framing her brilliant article around our work is the highest of compliments, and it really means a lot coming from someone who has been doing this work from both a support staff and faculty position for a long time now. People often ask ""What's in the water at UMW?"" or ""What are you all smoking?!"" And while I don't have a stock answer to that, I can say this: the simple process of openly narrating the work we do on our blogs has almost everything to do with our success. In other words, our willingness to regularly document the work we do, shared it openly, and even featured the work of others happening around the community has been what ultimately has made UMW's DTLT that much better (and we are that much better). When you think about it, we're not that different from a ton of other ed tech shops around the world: we support faculty, we run an LMS, we experiment with web-based tools, we pretend to understand what new media means, etc. For me, the one real difference is we have taken the time to narrate that process openly, which usually results in promoting the work happening around campus and injecting a little fun into the process (Andy Rush and I talk about this very thing all the time).  What's most interesting to me about this formula is that it isn't technical, it's all cultural. Rather than squawking about MOOCs and the inescapable educational apocalypse, we went ahead and built our own networked online course (the ever irreverent ds106) that was very much inspired by the OG MOOCs, but was designed for our particular campus culture. Why aren't more people doing this? Why are so many people wasting endless time writing about ""MOOCs and the Latest Form of Autodidactic Rock Climbing Walls"" rather then actually promoting the real work happening on the ground at their campuses. And I am not trying to be critical here because I have been to enough campuses the last four or five years to know there is a ton of awesome stuff happening at so many of them, it just so happens very few people are actually narrating it. The MOOC narrative has taken over, and we are all the poorer for it. Homegrown innovation on a university or college campus is not really all that complicated, it starts with the commitment to regularly tell the story about where you are and what you are doing rather than hanging to a bill of goods you are being sold about where you should be. Anyway, thanks Leslie, your article ruled, and it really made a bad month a little better. Big fan!  "Jim Groom,Syndication-Oriented Architecture: a Solution to Problem of Coherence,http://bavatuesdays.com/syndication-oriented-architecture-a-solution-to-problem-of-coherence/,5/16/2013,"I've been preparing a talk that I will be delivering this afternoon for Campus Technology's Virtual Leadership Summit. Given the session will be moderated by Gardner Campbell, I figured I'd take the opportunity to try and frame out the broader vision behind Domain of One's Own that goes well beyond the education sphere. In fact, it's remarkable how much of the vision is encapsulated in Jon Udellïs 2007 talk ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology."" For this presentation I have take seven clips from this talk ? each roughly two minutes long. I'll be using them as a touchstone for various concepts I want to try and demonstrate why it is essential at this moment to be encouraging people (and for the purposes of this talk faculty and students) to take control of the work they do online.  So, in order to both prepare for the talk and ""narrate my public agenda""simultaneously, I'm going to link to the seven clips and contextualize each of them as part of a larger narrative centered on how new methods of instruction can be augmented by an architecture that defines learners and faculty as personalized, connected nodes within the networked world of the web. We'll see how this goes.  1. The Problem of Coherence  Udell recognizes early on in this talk that despite all the great and magical qualities of the web to connect people and ideas, there remains an enduring issue and one which remains just as problematic six years on: a sense of coherence to the work we do online. In the following clip, Udell frames the issue of coherence in terms of what universities are used to in terms of monolithic IT systems that provide a sense of organization and structure that is anathema to the loosely coupled properties of the web, but endure because they make the interactions and exchanges fairly coherent, but using crude, outdated tools that accrue back to the university system rather than the individuals who actually created within them.  For example, you can do work within your school's content management system (CMS) or learning management system (LMS) but there is often no effortless way (or even possibility) to allow people to port that work into their own personal archive. So while you might have some semblance of coherence in these systems, they lack any of the any the affordances that make the web the web (these are the limitations xMOOCS still seem to operate within monolithic systems with none of the affordances of the web). On the other hand, the loosely distributed spaces for creation like blogs, wikis, twitter, tumblr, Facebook, etc. allow for greater interaction, collaboration, and promotion of what is happening at your university, but often at the cost of coherence. There has been no quick and easy way to aggregate that work within the university's existing CMS. So, in some ways the two are at ""loggerheads."" Let's listen to Udell first:  The Problem of Coherence  2. Hosted Lifebits  But in good form, Udell doesn't offer a problem without a solution. He suggests the problem of coherence might be addressed if we start looking at the ways in which we publish and republish our work online somewhat differently. Rather than continuing to use monolithic systems that people are asked to create on, we need to focus our attention on actually designing an architecture that can syndicate (or simply republish seamlessly) the work people are already creating on the web in their own various online spaces. What institutions and communities can then do is use a syndication-orientated architecture to place that work within the proper contexts. In other words, build a republishing system that takes the work happening in these various individual spaces and make it part of a larger, coherent community web presence. The shift is from monolithic, institutional systems to more atomized, individualized publishing that is reconstituted as a whole through its myriad, distributed parts ? not unlike Britian's technological revolutions during the Spanish Armada: build smaller, faster, more agile ships to overcome the monolithic, sluggish Spanish navy.  Read more from Udell about this one here.  Hosted Life Bits  3. A Personal Lifetime Digital Archive  This next audio clip is why I decided to include these clips in the first place. I ïd been presenting for the last four or five months using Udell's ideas as a framework for my talks, but every time I listen to this talk again I was frustrated at just how much I butchered his examples. But, alas, I refuse to give up, and I figured this format gives me a bit more help ?? The idea behind the Personal Lifetime Digital Archive is very compelling to me on many levels. The idea that we all have a ton of digital work both locally and online across various platforms means that we are going to have to continually grapple with the issue of archiving our stuff. I love the example of Suzy in this clip, and following her through what a personal digital archive might look like, and how understanding our digital lifebits as something we can both control and share feeds into a syndication-oriented architecture. What's more, it changes the axis of how a student might work across various instituions they come into contact with during their lifetime. We should be thinking of their time at school as one in which we are helping them understand the changing nature of publishing and online identity, and helping them understand this in a more nuanced, complex way, but more on that shortly.  Personal Lifetime Digital Archives  4. Not a Federation of Schools  Continuing on with Suzie's personal digital archive, I think one of the things Udell understands intuitively about the web that most universities fail to understand is that it's not just about them (another space wherein the xMOOCs are misguided). I guess as a university it's hard not to be self-centered, but the bottom line is that the idea of a personal digital archive goes well beyond schools, in fact it has to in order for it to be relevant. But, when you think about how most university IT infrastructure is setup right now, it is the absolute opposite. Once you leave, your access (and by extension your archive) is gone. What does this mean for helping the people we educate maintain a coherent, enduring personal archive of the work they've done while attending our university? Isn't making this easier part of what we should be doing?  Not a federation of schools  5. Narrating Your Public Agenda  And while the personal digital archive and the concomitant syndication- orientated architecture cannot be limited to a federation of schools for it to be relevant, at the same time personal publishing and personal archiving remain central to the academic enterprise. The idea of consistently and regularly narrating the work you do is the premise of an intellectual community. In that regard the web provides us to publish in a space of immediacy that enable a community to help each other refine their thinking ? kinda sounds like college, right?  Narrating your public agenda  6. Digital Identity  At UMW we have spent a lot of time considering how the work a student might do as part of their college career may be one way to get them thinking responsibly about their digital identity. Just how much the web is becoming integral to how the world beyond understands who you are is a central question for us. We want them to realize that from the start of their career at UMW, and hep them use their time at UMW to shape an online identity that reflects their best selves. And that is exactly what Udell is arguing for in this next clip, rather than parents and teachers abdicating the responsibility of helping students understand the web, it is our responsibility to show them how to use it responsibly. And that is not a simple matter of rules and protocol, rather it is best done through practical experience and conceptual possibility.  Online Identity  7. Networked Minds  ""How effective are you going to be able to be?"" This is where Udell brings back the vision behind the syndicated architecture, personal digital archives, and more into the fact that all these ideas are always in service to the core message: the web enables us to dramatically augment the possibilities for sharing and collaborating around ideas. The digitally networked world affords our student a whole new level of potentiality that we, as colleges and universities, must recognize and design for accordingly ? that is our responsibility. Fact is, we can't teach them what it means to be networked learners if we don't have faculty that understand this and the vision and architecture in place to realize it. What's more, it's a community's responsibility to offer a sense of coherence (in this regard the appropriately designed virtual space) for this to happen in the most powerful ways. Instructional design has never been more important, I just wish it would stop aping the monolithic systems and start adopting and cohering the loosely coupled nature of the web.  Networked Minds  "Tim Owens,Redefining Reclaim Efforts,https://blog.timowens.io/redefining-reclaim-efforts/,7/16/2013,"Over the past 2 years I've watched and later participated in the rhetoric of ""reclaiming our digital identities in the web spaces we inhabit. Reclaim means a lot of things to a lot of people. At the end of last year I decided I wanted to start bringing more of the artifacts I put out on the web back in house with this blog. By February I had dropped Dropbox for a self-hosted file sharing program called ownCloud, taking a page out of D'Arcy's playbook. In March when Google announced the impending doom of Google Reader I decided to jump in headfirst and get out from under the wing of as many Google products as possible. Since then I've hosted my own email, attempted to use Etherpad as a Google Docs replacement, and ran Fever on my server for RSS. Indeed it seemed like the perfect timing as we started ramping up our Domain of One's Own pilot and preaching the beauty of controlling your own space. I may not have gone full Richard Stallman but I definitely abandoned quite a bit in the name of ownership and control. It sucks and I'm done. For several months now I have punished myself by using subpar products whose only clear advantage was that I could see their source code. I let the rhetoric of ownership cloud the real nut of what's important: data portability. While everyone experimented with fancy new RSS Readers like Feedly in Google's wake, I stuck to my guns with Fever on the idea that it was ""good enough"" and was somehow better by being hosted on my web space. ""Good enough."" I've said that so many times, and yet data portability with RSS Readers already existed in the form of the open OPML format that most of these programs supported. While everyone else benefited from a host of great features from the variety of readers out there, I stopped reading feeds entirely on my iPad because it didn't support Fever, and stopped sharing as widely due to the lack of social network integration. I watched D'Arcy give up on ownCloud for now citing some deal breaker bugs and while those didn't affect me directly, the fact of the matter was that every time I used a service that would happily back up my data to Dropbox or integrate with Dropbox in some other way it caused me to wince. Etherpad was a complete failure due to requiring a constant running Node.js process and even after loading a variety of third-party plugins the collaboration wasn't even close and I found myself running back to Google Docs where everyone was. Google is no saint and sure, the closure of a service like Reader that was widely used by a large audience, was problematic. But they also support data portability in a huge way with Takeout and the fact that I found it fairly easy to get my stuff off of their servers is testament to that. The fear that if I don't own and control every piece of software I interact with it could disappear with no notice is not based in reality. Sure the overnight pop-up startups with no business model should be avoided if possible (or at the very least get regular backups if it's stuff you rely on), but the majority of these services give plenty of notice before closing their doors, offer tools to export your data cleanly, and for every door that closes it seems like 10 more open in this vibrant age of web programming. So I'm going to stop living in fear and start letting the web work for me. I'm still keenly aware of my digital identity and want to use my domain in a way that makes sense (likely as a form of backup whenever possible). But ultimately I want to be productive, social, and connected in a way that I've found very difficult these past few months by writing off a majority of the spaces that my network inhabits. I'm lowering my bar so I can start participating to a greater extent with the best of what's out there without getting bogged down with political and ethical dilemmas that will paralyze you to the greatness of the web.  "Tim Owens,A Distributed Domain of One's Own,https://blog.timowens.io/a-distributed-domain-of-ones-own/,7/18/2013,"The summer has been hot but quiet in Fredericksburg and I've had a lot of fun over the past few weeks working with Martha Burtis to get our new server up and running with the host of software we plan to use to roll out the Domain of One's Own project to all incoming students this fall. It's exciting to see an idea with so much history go from blog post to pilot to University-wide initiative. The Domain of One's Own project is probably the most exciting thing I've done in my professional career and it's certainly an idea that has found its moment as I talk to other educators and institutions about the possibilities and affordances it brings. But ultimately (there's always a but) not every institution has a group like DTLT they've invested in, or a culture that would allow the idea to take hold immediately. Faculty want to know how they can provide their students the affordances of a project like ours if their IT department isn't on board, or they don't have an instructional technology group that can support their experiments. It's time to fix that. I've written before about the history behind Hippie Hosting which serves as a precursor to the Domain of One's Own pilot and informed a lot of the technology and decisions that drive it. We all wanted to stop paying over $120 a year for a web host and come together to run a DIY server coop. 18 months in I can tell you it's been a great and informative journey learning the ropes of running a web host but Hippie Hosting is stronger than ever today. I've talked and dreamed with Jim before about how we could take the Domain of One's Own project and offer it to other institutions and individuals. What would that look like, to form a DIY coop of educational technology support centered around the idea of digital identity and the web? I want to believe that we as educators don't need top-down institutional support to grab at this gold, we need each other. Hippie Hosting didn't get where it is because of being faster, more reliable, or some feature set. Hippie Hosting is valuable because when you have a problem you get to talk to a human being (usually me or some of the other folks on Twitter) and we work together to fix it. No case numbers, no customer ID numbers, real human beings. What if we changed the narrative of ""Oh that idea is fine for you all because you've got the support of a great instructional technology group willing to help"" and flipped it on its head? This week Jim and I put together Reclaim Hosting as a sort of grand experiment to see where this goes. Our goal is simple: If you are planning to offer a class in the Fall that would benefit from offering your students domains and web hosting, we want to make that happen for you. Thanks to support from the Shuttleworth Foundation we aren't going to charge anything for web hosting, we'll cover that along with the software to make it all happen. We just need you to cover the cost of the domains ($12/student). Our pilot will run from August - December with the goal of learning, building, and growing this thing so we can open the doors widely in the Spring. If this sounds like something you want to be a part of, we need you to go to http://reclaimhosting.com/join to fill out a short form so we have a better idea of what our numbers look like. Reclaim Hosting is just one piece to the larger puzzle of how we allow people to easily feed their digital content back into a space they own and control. Making it easy for educators and students to get that space and start experimenting in it is an obvious first step, but over the next year we hope to play a part in building Reclaim Your Domain to provide a framework that allows people to take ownership and control of their digital identity. Anyone who read my previous post might think I had given up on the rhetoric of ""Reclaiming"" and that couldn't be further from the truth. Having a space to archive the distributed work is important and making it easy both to get that space and to aggregate the work you do in other spaces is important. I wouldn't partner with Jim to make this happen if I didn't think so, and I'm excited about all the possibilities this could afford us as a community. Let's build this together.  "Jim Groom,Y U NO Domain of One's Own?,http://bavatuesdays.com/y-u-no-domain-of-ones-own/,7/18/2013,"Tim Owens just framed out in this post how we can scale the possibilities of UMW's Domain of One's Own project to just about any professor from any school that might be interested. What's interesting here is that the ""we"" in that last sentence doesn't really refer to UMW, or even DTLT (although both helped to make it possible), rather it begins to define a broader community of folks who might be interested in pooling their edtech resources to actually help faculty and students experiment with the web beyond the LMS (which, ironically, is quickly being conflated with MOOCs).  Think of this for a second, with the Reclaim Hosting idea Tim lays out in the above linked post, we're essentially providing a space for interested teachers/faculty (and by extension students) to experiment on this hosting space for free. But that alone wouldn't be nearly enough, you can get free hosting elsewhere. What we want to do beyond that is use this space to provide support, encouragement, and, ideally, form a community of people that are interested in working collaboratively. What might it mean to openly imagine and frame a course alongside a community of people who'll help you do it? Would it look like a roving band of institutionally-agnostic, piratical ed tech folks who'll support you in rethinking how you use technology to augment teaching and learning in your course? I hope so!  Brian Lamb has referred to this model as a kind of co-op for edtech people who don't have the resources locally. Why not share those resources out that are most difficult to get? And if I were a betting man, I would wager moral support and encouragement from a community of folks who are interested in similar experiments is the most valuable resource available for just about anything you're trying to do. I can't really think of a precedent for this kind of community that builds good will through good deeds, can you? Was it #ds107, or something like that? Anyway, we're taking our cue from Brian Lamb, and offering up one little bit of what we can, free-hosting and support for any teacher/faculty interested in experimenting with building a course there (and we define teacher/faculty and course as loosely as possible, so don't feel excluded). In fact, we aren't necessarily new to this, back in 2008 we did something similar for Longwood University with UMW Blogs.  So, if you are interested, Join Us!  We can do this over the next five months for free in large part thanks to a flash grant I received from the Shuttleworth Foundation by way of David Wiley. THANK YOU! This is just one of three micro-projects we will be experimenting with thanks to this grant. This particular experiment is focused specifically on providing support for using a free, open source toolkit in the form of LAMP web hosting for interested faculty. The other two facets will be focused on 1) a series of plugins for ds106 that makes building a syndicated course space that much easier and 2) a broader, conceptual framing of what such a distributed architecture might look like for controlling one's data online, and how might we cobble/build it.  "Jim Groom,An Ode to UMW Faculty,http://bavatuesdays.com/an-ode-to-umw-faculty/,7/19/2013,"An Architecture of Amazing Possibility  Andr?a Livi Smith, who's a Historic Preservation professor at UMW, found time on her blog to write a little ode honoring UMW's DTLT. She contextualized it with an explanation as to why she is so enamored with this cutting edge, highly attractive group of instructional technologists ??  > They set up the blog aggregator for my Paris class. I love this thing: it keeps all my students' blogs in one place, making for easy commenting and grading [the aggregator was the handy work of Alan Levine, I believe]. They also set up the system for my scavenger hunt which will be held in Paris later in the summer. (And no, you can't see it yet. It'll be the star of another post) All I had to do was explain what I wanted, what had not worked last year (seriously, it deserved an #epicfail) and voila! Now I have a system that will make it easier on the students and on me, and will be ready for the next trip, too.  >  > I can just imagine how this would have worked at another school. One scenario: ""you don't use the CMS? Then figure this out yourself."" Another: ""let's figure out how to make the CMS do this."" This second option would actually be WORSE. Some things you can't shoehorn to work well together. It's like garlic and chocolate. I'm not saying Canvas can't handle photos, but I would imagine that it would be a very  convoluted solution to have 40+ photos from different teams to be accessible on a single screen for easy comparison.  That's right, it's not like we don't support learning management systems, we most certainly do, and Lisa Ames has been an amazing part of this group in that regard. But we only dedicate about 1/6 of our respurces to that, the vast majority of what we do is work with faculty to imagine what they want to do and how we can help them do it using a wide range of resources at our disposal. I love how Andi articulates what makes UMW special in this regard, it's a matter of support and the ability to quickly scale a custmoized learning environment for faculty. We've become masters at that by experimenting with open source tools and cheap web hosting. Interestingly enough, this is exactly the approach we are trying to scale beyond UMW with Reclaim Hosting that Tim Owens framed beautifully here.  What's more, Andi herself has become masterful at managing her own domain over the last six months. her work in the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative was truly brilliant, and her Digital Bridging blog is the tale of the tape. She's fired up about the digital, is an awesome person to work with, and has been breaking new ground with Martha Burtis on research applications for a customized WordPress blog for collecting data on historic structures around Fredericksburg (but I'll let them talk about that).  Andi is a force of nature, and like most of the faculty at UMW, she came here because she loves teaching. In fact, we have no shortage of great teachers at UMW, and that is truly be the secret sauce behind DTLT's success. We couldn't do what we love to do, i.e. experiment wildly with technology in the classroom, if we did n't have such awesome, engaged faculty that treat us as partners in the process. So here is an ode right back at Andi and the rest of UMW's awesome faculty:  > The UMW faculty, they teach 4/4,  And labor for love with an experimental galore.  But when it comes to the LMS, It's nevermore, nevermore  They rock the open web, and innovation abounds  Augmenting learning with tech continually astounds  We're making the myths at UMW because we're working as a well-oiled community, rather than a machine. You can do a lot of great things when everyone involved is willing to experiment openly.#umwfaculty4life  "Jim Groom,"Gulou or, Public Scholarship in the Digital Age",http://bavatuesdays.com/golou-or-public-scholarship-in-the-digital-age/,7/19/2013,"This post is long overdue, and if I hadn't checked out for a couple of months in April and May it would have been blogged on the bava a lot earlier. In fact, it's criminal it hasn't been broadcast more widely around the UMW community because the fact that Sue Fernsebner, a Chinese history scholar and faculty member in the History department at UMW, has a blog that has become a spotlight page for news on Tumblr is a kind of a big deal. Sue lays out the whole phenomenon far better than I ever could in this post. I love the way she ponders the implications of her blog being featured alongside major mass media new outlets:  > It's now introduced there alongside established media (Reuters, LA Times, CNN, USA Today, etc.) and also accompanies other, less traditional but equally popular sites for news consumption (e.g. The Daily Show) on the same page.  >  > I'm just beginning to ponder the implications. What does it mean that an individual's site ? one person's own, simple Tumblr ? is beside the site of a news agency like, say, Reuters, a major news organization founded in 1851 (and now owned by The Thompson Corporation)? More immediately, at least for a scholar of China and Asian Studies, what does it mean that a microblogging, pop media site such as Tumblr is interested in featuring stories from that region at its top-most news page?  I love this! And if I might be so bold to try and answer some of these questions, I would argue it represents a new era of the scholar. I was first introduced to the idea of the public scholar back in the late 90s when I was at the CUNY Grad Center. The definition I heard was that a public scholar was an academic who might give a few public lectures a year and/or write an article or column for a well-known, popular magazine. Morris Dickstein and Luke Menand (both big names in the field working in the English department at the Grad Center at the time) are considered public scholars as such, but it seemed to me that their scope was only public in a rarified , NY intellectual cultural frame. I don't mean this as a criticism ? I'm a huge fan of Dickstein's ? as much as a basis for some of the limitations of the idea of a public scholar in the academy before the web.  What happens when a scholar from UMW, a small public liberal arts university all too often overlooked when it comes to scholarship, can turn a simple, free resource sharing site on Tumblr into a featured, popular news site read by tens of thousands of people daily? That's pretty mind blowing to me, and given how cool and awesome Sue is (I mean she's pioneering animated GIFs as film analysis in her Chinese film class!) it couldn't have happened to a better person. We have had an amazing group of fellows in the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative this past Spring, and while Sue's work with Tumblr pre- dates that initiative, but still I would like to claim her as the poster child for Domain of One's Own. But, in the end, that might turn into a faculty cage match given how many faculty stepped up their game to Crouching Tiger levels of awesome! ?? I love featuring faculty work, it has been too long since I have, maybe it's time to start featuring just what all those amazing faculty fellows did as part of the Domain of one's Own initiative.

Andy picks it up and fixes it soon after the 22 minute mark. I'll be editing this out sometime soon, apologies in the meantime.</del> Those clips with heavy feedback loop have been edited out.  After a year and a half hiatus DTLT Today is finally back in action with episode 104. Even better, we had the whole old gold crew together (i.e. Martha Burtis, Andy Rush, Tim Owens, and myself) to talk about the Domain of One's Own project we're kicking off this Fall for 1000 freshman.  I pushed for this episode because I was blown away by how streamlined Tim Owens and Martha Burtis had engineered the sign-up using the client management software WHMCS. It's extremely slick; a two step process that gives students and faculty alike their own domain and web hosting immediately. What's more, the domain propagates in less than 10 minutes. It's amazing to see how cleanly and professionally this project has come along. Martha and Tim talk a bit about their setup process in the above episode, which I find nothing short of fascinating, particularly the bafflement of the WHMCS community forums when they were inquiring how to give domains away for free and prevent anyone from buying anything else. A new kind of client software! ??  Given all our success we got a little cocky (royal we, it's all TIM OWENS!) and decided to open a parallel project up to any interested teachers and faculty over at Reclaim Hosting. Over the next two weeks we are going to be knee deep in support documentation and videos for Domain of One's Own, and what struck me today is that we can easily run this project in terms of support with an eye to the open web. Not unlike ds106, we can focus and build the project for our immediate community, but at the same time open it up to a larger community for anyone interested. Fact is, we aren't duplicating efforts, we would be doing this stuff anyway. After Tim figured out how to make the process so smooth to clone such a model was simple, we just needed some money to float the server and software cost for an academic year, and thanks to the Shuttleworth Foundation flash grant I received (thanks to David Wiley) we could do it.  Another thing that struck me as we were doing DTLT Today yesterday was that we could also plan every Monday afternoon throughout the Fall semester on doing an episode of DTLT Today focused on getting people familiar with CPanel, installing open source applications, setting up aggregator blogs, etc. Seems to me we would be killing two birds with one stone, supporting the local students, staff and faculty at UMW as well as any interested teachers/faculty from any interested school, college, and/or university (hell, you don't even have to be part of any of them). Initially this was the same reason we opened up ds106, because folks wanted to know how to manage their own web host, access their databases, setup subdomains, customize open source applications, and much more.  Even cooler, we can make it so that any interested faculty can control and manage their students accounts. They can set them up with domains, access their CPanels, and generally work with them if they are having issues. It gives the students their own space and gets them familiar with the possibilities of open source web-based applications while at the same time giving the faculty the ability to help them as they get started. I love this idea!  At lunch yesterday Tim referred to this model as ""distributed ed tech"" that we can all do if we simply point our work a bit more towards a community beyond our campus. What's more, you have to provide a shared object of attention and invite people in so you can have a wider community. But not at the expense of the local, but rather to augment what's happening locally, which has been proven to be the case with ds106.  I know firsthand there are a lot awesome people who not only could use some focused help with managing web hosting for themselves, as well as a community, but also would bring a mojo to community engagement that is remarkable. I am referring particularly to Todd Conaway's post ""Owning and Sharing: Like Buying a Coke"" wherein he illustrates the various cultural issues that are wide spread across higher ed (anything from financial woes to limited human resources to despotic IT departments to a general institution bureaucracy and malaise) that such a community of distributed edtech might help a lot of people overcome for a real, compelling change in their local cultures. We're all doing what we are doing anyway, it's now time to just point it outwards a bit so that we can start sharing resources, working smarter, and build the cross-campus, inter-institutional connections our schools, colleges and universities seem to do everything in their power to prevent.  "Jim Groom,Paris is Burning through Syndication,http://bavatuesdays.com/paris-is-burning-through-syndication/,7/22/2013,"> Have I ever mentioned how awesome #UMWïs Study Abroad blog aggregator is? More than 200 posts since June. #4Life  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) July 20, 2013  When I tweeted out how awesome UMW's Study Abroad aggregator blog is a few folks asked me how we're doing the syndication. Aggregation is something I've written about so often on the bava blog that I'm afraid I take for granted. That said, I really don't want to because I truly believe it is the best way to foster distributed communities, enable ownership of one's own work, and keep a centralized archive all at once. Aggregation by way of RSS-enabled syndication is still the simplest way at this stuff, and I'm gonna try and prove that once again ??  So with the aforementioned Study Abroad blog aggregator we have almost 90 feeds that have been added (self-service style) over the last two and half years that have syndicated more than 2300 posts. We do this using the plugin called FeedWordPress, which allows you to add and syndicate URLs from just about any service with an RSS feed. For example, the Study Abroad aggregator has feeds from worpress.com, blogger, tumblr, self-hosted sites, and UMW Blogs blogs. It allows anyone with an RSS enabled site to feed in.  In order to make the process more streamlined, we are using another plugin called Add Link Widget which allows people to add a URL from the sidebar. Once it is added it's categorized as ""Contributor"" which immediately adds it to FeedWordPress (I recommend password protecting this field in the sidebar to avoid spammers). You can check in on occasion to make sure added feeds have been auto-discovered properly, and then you are set.  So, using this simple two-plugin combination we have created a hub for thousands of posts from UMW student studying all over the globe. Now, let's add another layer of syndication into this equation. I setup the Study Abroad aggregator blog a couple of years ago on a lark because I started to see that students at UMW were just doing this of their own volition to share adventures with family and friends. But this is not an option limited to me, any faculty member or student that has a UMW Blog (or a self-hosted WordPress blog) can do the same exact thing ? and after seven years of playing with this we actually have a number of faculty who do!  Exhibit P (for Paris!), Historic Preservation professor Andi Livi-Smith worked with Alan Levine last Summer to setup her Preservation Abroad aggregator blog which syndicates posts from various sites the students setup to document their experience abroad for a month in Paris, France. And while going to Paris would be preferable, being able to see all the amazing places the students visit and document made the fact I wasn't there that much worse ?? But more seriously, it is an amazing distributed documentary of the class experience that Andi can use to centrally follow and grade their work in one space. Additionally, the students own and control the sites on whatever service they used, but a centralized archive of the course remains beyond the course because each of the distributed posts are reproduced in preserved on the aggregator blog. Best of both worlds? I would say, ""OUI, OUI""!  Now for the aggregators within aggregators twist. So Andi sets up this awesome course aggregator that is pulling in her students work to one central space of their study abroad experience. Why can't we take the RSS feed from her course aggregator and add it to the Study Abroad aggregator site? Well, we can, we are, and it's seamless. Aggregate ALL the aggregators! In many ways this is the prototype for how I wish academic department sites would start shaping the flow of the various work they are doing on social media, UMW Blogs, Domain of One's Own sites, course sites, etc.  We are doing this with our official DTLT page on umw.edu. What's more, I've used the tags dtlt and featured on this post which are triggers for the DTLT site to syndicate this post and put it on the front page as featured news. How about that? Syndication and aggregation, baby, it's the future. And while Paris, Rome, and higher ed is burning, we continue to blaze the trail. Come on now, isn't it time you started aggregating and syndicating the future, hippies? And while I've said it a million times on this site before, it is still so right! That said, the fact that so much of it has been focused on WordPress has been a real limitation, but even that will soon be removed. There's more in heaven and earth, edtech, than you dream of in your corporate, vendor-driven philosophy ??  "Jim Groom,Reclaim Hosting: Battling Digital Somnabulism One Domain at a Time,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-hosting-battling-digital-somnabulism-one-domain-at-a-time/,7/26/2013,"A week after launching Reclaim Hosting it seems like the project has hit a broader, international nerve. By a conservative count Tim Owens and I did this morning , it looks like we're going to need a bigger boat  based on the overwhelming interest that, by a conservative estimate, would result in more than 2000 accounts come August 15ht when we open up sign-ups. What's more exciting that the crazy amount of people interested, is the realization that a lot of people want a communal approach to an open source toolkit for their teaching and learning.  As it turns out we can deal with the issue of scale when it comes to servers, just get another one (or three!), right Tim? However, the idea of trying to create a community wherein students and faculty can share what they are doing in this space in order to model different approaches, help one another out, and feedback what they've learned is the real nut to crack. Tim and I are working on how we might build an environment that harnesses a community of support (which itself will be evolving depending on the community), and I imagine our work with ds106 will help us in that regard. The fact that we can so easily open up the possibility for something like Domain of One's Own to students, instructors, academic departments, and institutions around the world (and this is truly a global project) using a small flash grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation is remarkable.  That said, I have to acknowledge that Tim Owens deserves the lion's share of the credit. He cloned the work he and Martha Burtis are doing with UMW Domains in no time flat, and it will come as no surprise that Reclaim Hosting is inspired by the Domain of One's Own project happening at UMW this Fall. What's more, it follows in a long line of projects coming out of UMW's DTLT like the Bluehost Experiment, ds106 and UMW Blogs. DTLT has made it a habit over the last ten years of pointing its initiatives towards the web in order to share the work we're doing, as well as allow others to piggyback on them if their environment is less than conducive to innovation.  The secret is that we're not the one's ""sacrificing"" our limited resources for the good of the cause by sharing out work. Rather, the process pays back to UMW 1000 fold. We get access to a wide range of approaches all over the world from different education levels (K12, undergraduate, graduate, etc.) that help us better understand how to approach Domain of One's Own locally. We also hook into a community of students and instructors that want to experiment, exposing us to some of the most innovative approaches going and forcing us to stay sharp at home. What's more, it often brings attention to your work. When you open your work up, you're usually the one that benefits as a result. In fact, I would argue that the community as a whole does.  On that note, I was excited to see Chronicle intern reporter Sara Grossman's article on Reclaim Hosting. She took the time to follow-up on her interview with us several times, and I think her article does justice to the project:  > The goal [of Reclaim Hosting] is to provide instructors and administrators with a simple way to give students personal domains and Web hosting they can own and control.  That's right, and while the pedants will argue how much can you truly own or control a domain or hosting (""it's leasing!""), the idea behind this project is to move beyond a simple consumer attitude towards the web. In order to truly engage this participatory medium on your own terms, you need to understand how it works. This means experimenting with installing applications, browsing database tables, experimenting with DNS, mapping domains, etc. Whats more, it's about avoiding our culture's tendency of ""falling into a state of digital somnambulism,"" to quote Cathy Derecki's must read post on the topic titled ""Time to Fight the Digital Nanny State."" In fact, I get excited when I think an entire community college system like VCCS is considering the implications of such an approach.  In the following video Tim and I frame this project in more detail. We work through some of the details of how we are trying to share resources, develop a distributed community site, and create an ongoing video series wherein we explore the possibilities of various open source applications. I imagine it will cover approaches to building distributed course sites, managing your students cPanel accounts, as well as cover a series of various technical details behind web hosting. But all this analyzing is paralyzing, it's time to play this dang thing!  "Jim Groom,Syndicate This: a Practical Dream Vision of Syndication for UMW's Website,http://bavatuesdays.com/syndicate-this-a-practical-dream-vision-of-syndication-for-umws-website/,8/6/2013,"I've written extensively about the importance of syndication to framing a community for a long time on this blog. In fact, recently I've even shied away from writing about it because I feel I've beaten that horse to death. Nonetheless, I can't quit you RSS. So, let's do that dance one more time.  Last year, just about this time, I wrote about how UMW's main webpage is poised to become a syndication hub that allows sites all over umw.edu to syndicate content from a wide array of relevant sites. At the same time Curtiss Grymala and Cathy Derecki rolled out the ability for faculty profile pages to aggregate their work from a wide range of social media sites. A year later both these features are that much more important as we start get faculty and students alike to manage and control their web presence on their own domain with Domain of One's Own.  After writing my last post yesterday about how a somewhat simple, easy solution that allows faculty to syndicate students' work into a course site is essential to making the syndication hub work, I started to reflect again on the umw.edu setup as syndication laboratory. Almost three years ago the Eagle Eye site was created so that faculty and staff could submit relevant news, announcements, and professional notes to the community at large. What's more, every Thursday an email-friendly version went out to the entire community. I wrote about this setup over a year ago, commenting on how it was an example of how a model like this can help the UMW community get a ""birds-eye view"" of what's happening on campus.  > And then I realizedƒ like I was shotƒ like I was shot with a diamondƒ a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, my Godƒ the genius of that!  Why aren't we marrying EagleEye and the syndication hub for umw.edu? Fact is, EagleEye has already been ported off UMW Blogs and is now officially part of umw.edu. Given that, how hard would it be to have anyone submitting news, announcements, or professional notes to EagleEye simply publish it directly on their respective department site with a specific tag? If that were the case, which seems logical enough, we tell people to tag any post that they want featured in Eagle Eye with the tag eagleeye. After that, any post within the UMW Webpage tagged eagleeye will syndicate directly into EagleEye as a draft that can then be vetted, edited and published for the Thursday email.  Think about it, a lot of people/departments are regularly posting to Eagle Eye already. With over 3500 posts in the last three years, that's an average of 3 posts a day, everyday for three years. That's a lot of solid, relevant content that is specifically focused on our community. Now, what if we allowed everyone in the community to post that relevant content on their departmental site with the knowledge that it will be reproduced seamlessly to EagleEye if they use a certain tag? It's the Udellian dream of making things easier through syndication come true, what's more it makes the UMW webpage that much richer because as of now departments and/or individuals are not reproducing the posts they make on EagleEye on their departmental webpages (DTLT is the only one doing this, and as of now we have to do that manually by reproducing the post because the feeds on EagleEye are balking, such as http://eagleeye.umw.edu/tag/dtlt/feed).  I don't know if this makes any sense at all, but I guess I need to keep on knocking my head against the syndication wall because I don't have much else. But even more than that, if we like the open, distributed web, this is the best way at it without trying to package the whole thing into an app.  "Brynn Boyer,UMW Freshmen Build Digital Identities Through Innovative Project,http://www.umw.edu/news/2013/08/13/umw-freshmen-build-digital-identities-through-innovative-project/,8/13/2013,"This fall, incoming freshmen at the University of Mary Washington will have the opportunity to create their digital identities through the Domain of One's Own initiative. The pioneering project provides free, personal domain names and web hosting to help students take responsibility for their online identities, as well as explore the implications of what it might mean for them to take control of their work and manage their own portfolios. Domain of One's Own reinforces UMW as a leader in higher education, according to Director of Teaching and Learning Technologies Jim Groom, since it is evidence that emerging technologies are central to the university's student and faculty experience, not afterthoughts. ""Domain of One's Own is an opportunity to build on a tradition we have had for the past 10 years to build the Web into the curriculum,"" said Groom, whom the Chronicle of Higher Education named one of a dozen top tech innovators in 2012. ""UMW is one of the first [colleges and universities] to think about this in a central way. Mary Washington is suggesting and doing something radically different. We are building the Web into the fabric of how we teach and learn here."" Domain of One's Own started as a pilot project in 2012, with more than 400 students and 30 faculty participating. It is the brainchild of Groom and his colleagues in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies. The initiative has two main goals, Instructional Technology Specialist Tim Owens explained, with the first focused on the value of archives and portfolios for students' future professional and academic endeavors. ""The other side of it is that it is valuable for students just to inhabit the Web and understand how the Web works,"" he said. ""It's important for us to have those conversations with students about how stuff happens on the Web and how they can control it."" æ Haley Campbell '13 has used her domain as a portfolio and academic blog. Haley Campbell '13 has used her http://aetherbunny.com/ domain as everything from a portfolio to an academic blog to a place to experiment with online editing tools. ""A lot of people take the Internet for granted,"" Campbell said. ""They know they have to use it, but they don't necessarily think about how they're using it. [Domain of One's Own] encourages critical thinking about those tools."" The initiative has created a buzz on and off campus, including in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Wired, The Web Host Industry Review and The Center for Digital Education. The idea for the initiative started when the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies' staff received their own domains and web spaces in 2004. ""Two years later, after we saw how it empowered us in so many ways, we informally banded around this idea of ïwouldn't it be cool if we could give this to every student?'"" said Martha Burtis, special projects coordinator. ""It really evolved over about 10 years to where we are now."" For Burtis, Domain of One's Own isn't just about technology, it's about transforming students through meaningful interactions. ""That kind of empowerment is huge in terms of what we can do for our students,"" she said.

Yesterday Reclaim Hosting went live, and it's exactly what Tim and I were talking about on that train ride back to Fredericksburg ten months ago. Reclaim Hosting affords teachers, faculty, students, and institutions all over the world the ability to quickly setup a domain and web hosting account within the context of a larger educational community. In fact, I think Audrey Watter's reference to Domain of One's Own as one of the edtech start-ups of 2012 was somewhat prescient and generative, because she helped us see that the work we're doing has a broader field of influence then we first realized.  I'm really excited by the idea that a community of educators and students can start collaborating the possibilities of managing and experimenting with an open source toolbox. In many ways, the series I am working on with Howard Rheingold right now is a sign of some of the larger possibilities for doing open, distributed edtech. That said, this could not have been done without the help of a number of people in the community who stepped up and loaned us the money to cover the domain costs as we get started. The number of people that expressed interest in Reclaim Hosting was daunting, and we needed to be sure we could cover the demand.  In particular, Mike Caulfield loaned us the lion's share of the money so far to cover the upfront costs of domains as we get started, without him we couldn't open this as quickly as we have. But Mike was not alone in his faith in this project, we've raised over $12,000 thanks to Paul Bond, Boone Gorges, Brian Lamb, Jeff McCLurken, Mariana Funes, John Maxwell, Grant Potter, Jess Rigelhaupt, Jonathan Worth, and Christina Hendricks.

I'm really loving the work with Howard to build out his course site, and once again explore for myself what's possible with tools like WordPress and MediaWiki. In fact, the whole idea around ds106, Domain of One's Own, Reclaim Hosting, etc., is that you dig into stuff like this and have a community of support to help you. A huge reason why folks wouldn't even consider this option is that it's way too onerous to do alone, but we may just solve that by working on this stuff as a community. Open and distributed edtech ? you have a problem, we can help you fix it! We're DEDtech! Anyway, that's the dream.  As for this episode, Howard and I spent some time in the beginning on the WHYs. Why have your students blog openly? Why have them take control of their digital domain? Why build these aggregated spaces? What has been the biggest treat about pairing up with Howard is that he makes me explain some of the assumptions I've been carrying around for years. I've been pushing syndication of student blogs into course hubs at UMW for six or seven years now. We've been using the FeedWordPress plugin for five or six of them. This stuff is like water to us, and while others might be waking up to it recently ? it's been part of our edtech DNA at UMW for a while. So having Howard have me try and actually explain why a faculty member might want to do this is awesome. What's more, as we go through these sessions it's a real conversation between two people who are negotiating what the course framework might look like. The coolest part is we're sharing it in hopes that others get some ideas, frame their own questions, and potentially work through a similar model. I feel like I am doing the best kind of instructional technology again: exploratory, customized frameworks that scale to the size of a single professor ? a hub that reflects the personality of a course, but refuses to subsume the students within it. This is the kind of instructional technology that truly rocks ? LMSs still suck!  After the WHYs, we covered a few customizations to his WordPress hub such as adding a widget for the Twitter conversation around his #comm182 course hashtag. Thanks to Tim Owens, I recommended the native widget from Twitter that actually works well. Just go to Your Twitter settings?>widgets and you have all sorts of options.  After that we discussed how to create custom menus in WordPress to organize pages on the course hub. What's more, the links option in custom menus is a very useful feature that I think a ton of faculty will find appealing for loosely integrating a range of external sites into one central hub. We flirted with the idea of themes, but we'll be spending more time in the next episode ? which is Tuesday, August 20th btw ? talking about the myriad possibilities in that department. About half way through we installed a MediaWiki and went over the affordances of that technology. I particularly liked our discussion about wikis because we actually went back-and-forth about what he may or may not need. I don't recommend MediaWiki lightly because it can be a real pain in the ass, at the same time it is powerful and every time I set one up for a class I see the immense possibilities all over again. That said, when I soon realize I have to edit a localsettings.php file to get a attractive icon for branding a new wiki some of that luster is lost. Truly a love hate relationship.  I've demonstrated some basic editing for MediaWiki that we have document for the course here, and I am working on a broader HowTo wiki page for this class that I'm expecting other folks who want to do a course like this might use, copy, or customize for their own course. I'll be talking about integrating WordPress and MediaWiki more tightly in the next episode, as well as the possibilities with plugins like Wiki Embed ? which I think is awesome. I also found this cool MediaWiki extension I hadn't seen before that enables seamless Poem formatting, which is a complete nightmare in WordPress. Who knew? I'll highlight all these MediaWiki extensions, integration, and WordPress themes and more in the next episode. Until then, stay syndicated baby!  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own Poster: Visualizing the Connections,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-poster-visualizing-the-connections/,8/20/2013,"Giulia Forsythe's Domain of One's Own Poster  So far we've had three different posters printed to promote the Domain of One's Own initiative, and thanks to Giulia Forsythe we have yet another. Giulia's visual not only captures all the complex facets and connections that this project represents culturally, curricularly, and communally (Martha Burtis gives an excellent history the long history of Domain of One's Own), but it is like a rich tapestry to look at. Add to that her thoughtful and nuanced post about the creation process and you have a truly remarkable reflection of what this initiative represents. I plan to have a number of smaller versions printed, but a larger, full-blown version printed and framed for our offices.  "Jim Groom,Syndicated Personal Portfolios: The Case of Stephen J. Farnsworth,http://bavatuesdays.com/syndicated-personal-portfolios-the-case-of-stephen-j-farnsworth/,8/22/2013,"I've still yet to write a manifesto about how awesome the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative was in some many ways, but the problem is there's far more than a mouthful of awesome. So, I am trying to deal with this by taking one small bite at a time ?? Here's anotherƒ  Stephen J. Farnsworth is professor of Political Science here at UMW, as well as in impressively prolific scholar, pundit, and presenter. He's constantly being interviewed by news outlets in the DC area on a range of political matters, and as we were working on his personal portfolio site as part of the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative I started to wonder how we could start syndicating all this stuff in. We quickly discovered that most major news agencies, both locally and abroad, don't have an easy and consistent mechanism to syndicate specific works he has been a part from their sites.  The only clean feed we could get from any of these various news agencies was C-SPAN ? bully for the public sphere! C-SPAN has a recent appearances page for people who were part of their broadcast, and that page has a clean feed that we can pull right into his portfolio via FeedWordPress, but that's the only one we could find. What a shame, I can't imagine it hasn't occurred to The Washington Post, the Richmond Dispatch and just about every local TV and radio station that they need a lightweight taxonomy based on tags or categoroes to organize when a guest has been quoted, interviewed, etc. so that it can be more broadly shared by these people who are contributing to the value of their infromation? This seems to be a larger example of how technical and information literacy is so crucial, and why syndication is still so freaking important as a mechanism to a simple tool for structuring and seamlessly sharing content within and beyond an organization.  Which, in turn, is why I've been pushing for UMW to get more savvy when it comes to syndicating content. For example, Stephen Farnsworth has been submitting the professional work he has been doing to EagleEye, UMW's Faculty and Staff Weekly Newletter on a regular basis over the last two years. He has over eighty entries in the newsletter, and thanks to an agreed upon tag for all faculty and staff we can pull a feed with all his professional notes directly from EagleEye right into his portfolio page. The feed he is syndicating from is http://eagleeye.umw.edu/tag/sfarnswo/feed and what's nice is now he shouldn't have to reproduce effort. Whatever is entered into EagleEye will automatically syndicate into the professional notes section of his portfolio.  Even cooler, we could work this the other way around and have EagleEye pull a tagged feed from every interested faculty and staff member's personal website as a way to seamlessly syndicate and aggregate their professional notes from their own online space. For example, I could use the tag EagleEye on this blog to send any posts about my own professional work to EagleEye. This not only encourages faculty and staff to share the work they're doing, which is already a reality thanks in part to EagleEye. But it also enables them to do it on their own space that can seamlessly broadcast to the entire UMW community. Add to that the fact we can now provide them with their own domain and web hosting, and you have the perfect storm for this stuff taking root.  "Jim Groom,The Domain is Right,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-domain-is-right/,8/31/2013,"This past week UMW's Division of Teaching and Learnign Technologies rolled out what's most certainly our most ambitious project yet: Domain of One's Own. I've written a lot about this project over the last year or so, and it's surreal to think it's up and running. Domain of One's Own provides any interested Freshman at UMW with his or her own domain and web hosting to start taking control of their identity on the web. The first week didn't come without it's highs and lows, and Martha Burtis's awesomely comprehensive post recaps what's transpired thus far. While we dreamed 1000 Freshman would sign- up day one, at the same time we knew it was gonna take a lot of work to make this fly. We've been through this all before with projects like UMW Blogs and ds06, great things need to grow organically as part of a community. And that's what we have to focus on this year, and I have no doubt it will be a resounding success because Domain of One's Own is pure and good and RIGHT.  Which reminds me, last Sunday DTLT did a half-hour presentation for all Freshman in which we introduced and officially rolled out Domain of One's Own. It was an update of a legendary group presentation we did back in 2007, and it features everything from a terribly bad video presentation by Martha to a trailer for Bagman comes to UMW (more on this genius below) to an overview of the actual project to the capstone finale: ""The Domain is Right""  ? a gameshow in which students are invited on stage to strut their knowledge of all things web. [For the record, Andy Rush wore his Tuxedo, need I say more?] This was a total blast, and it's yet another testament that with the addition of Tim Owens and Ryan Brazell DTLT is as kickass as we have ever been. When you can put together a presentation like this as quickly and easily as we did, the proof is in the pudding. Oh yeah, and then there's the whole Domain of One's Own infrastructure Tim Owens nailed last Spring ? genius!  As part of the documentation and the more generalized narrative of Domain of One's Own DTLT has adopted a mascot of sorts: Bagman! While we were out at lunch a week or two before classes started, Martha got the idea that we should have the character Bagman be a Freshman coming to UMW, and work with him to go through all the steps of Domain of One's own: namely signing-up, choosing a domain, installing applications, etc. The great Brian Ralph Short ? who has a million and one other things going on ? was unbelievably gracious and agreed to hep us out. Lo and behold, we have the beginnings of a whole transmedia campaign for Domain of One's Own starring ds106's very own Bagman (I love it when world's collide). Check out the trailer as well as the first three videos below (you can follow the ongoing series here).  The Trailer for ""Bagman Goes to UMW""    Bagman's Introduction to a Domain of One's Own    Bagman Chooses a Domain Name    Bagman Signs-up for a Domain of One's Own    UMW is the college upon the hill, and we will shine a light for the heathens and unbelievers! Domain of One's own is #4life!  "Jim Groom,What I'm up toƒ.,http://bavatuesdays.com/what-im-up-to/,9/4/2013,"Think of this as a placeholder post until I can get around blogging each one of the points below in some detail. We're already midway through week 2 of the semester and I'm desparately trying to keep my head above water. In the meantime, here's what:     Domain of One's Own: Not only is it up and running, but it's as awesome as we thought it would be. The initiative is picking up momentum fast at UMW ? and without even pushing the curricular side of things we have had remarkable interest. I already blogged out our group presentation the Sunday before classes started, but Martha has the best play-by-play for week 1.    Reclaim Hosting: Tim Owens and I started a forked version of Domain of One's Own for any interested faculty, student, course, department or instituion called Reclaim Hosting. This project blowing up quick. In the last two days alone we've had almost 100 sign-ups! Projects by Dave Parry at St Joseph's, Quinn Warnick at Virginia Tech, Mark Sample at Davidson College, John Maxwell at SFU, and Michael Branson Smith at CUNY's York College are driving most of the sign-ups as of now. We also have faculty experimenters Howard Rheingold and Nada Dabbagh who are designing their courses in the open! Tim setup a pretty sslick Discourse forum for Howard's course that has me experiencing some forum envy. What's remains awesome for me about Reclaim is we're immediately turning around what we've learned from the Domains project for anyone interested in experimenting for next to nothing. Sharing at its best. Also, Tim has figured out how to give a Quinn Warnick control over his students cPanels, and abstracted level of management for faculty to support thier students learning this stuff ? I love this whole thing.    The Ryan Brazell Experiment: Possibly the greatest thing about my day-to-day life right now is Ryan Brazell. At UMW for just six weeks, he has already been working with more than a dozen professors, doing class visits, imagining Domain of One's Own, and much more. I would like to take credit, but fact is he is just damn good. Ryan is reminding us all in DTLT how good it is to be at full capacity and have someone on the ground, doing amazing stuff with faculty, and reconnecting us to our core mission: faculty outreach and development. I pretended to mentor him for the first week of classes, but I have officially been depracted to ""eye candy,"" and the master has stepped in and taken control of the situation. This is all very goood, despite my portestations.    The OpenVA and Minding the Future Conferneces: As I mentioned previously, last month UMW's President, Rick Hurley, asked me if we might be able to build on the momentum of OpenVA to frame some of the national questions of the future of higher education for an audience of university presidents, business folks, etc. This quickly turned into a free, open conference that anyone can attend the day before OpenVA (October 14th) that will feature some pretty awesome folks. And that's just the prelude to the mian event: OpenVA. I really am blown away by how things aligned with these two events, both of which I think look awesome. That said, I've been OpenVA conference boy for almost two years now, I'm ready for this one to happen. I want some of my day back!    The Virginia Technology Incubator: This one is also pretty crazy, and is born directly out of the work on OpenVA. I blogged the very long version of all this here, so what follows is the short version. DTLT (with the help of Paul Stacey, Grant Potter, and Brian Lamb) has helped author a proposal with SCHEV to introduce a state-wide, virtual Technology incubator that will focus on a specific theme for one year and bring faculty, students, and topic experts together to hack at that topic. I'm not sure if this will amount to anything, it still has to get approved by SCHEV and then approvd by the Virginia legislature but if I it falls flat, it's still been a remarkably eye-opening lesson to learnjsut how hungry folks are for good ideas when it comes to what we do. If you get a chance, consider working on a state/province-wide committee, I've found the experience pretty rewarding thus far.    The Mario Bava Film Festival: This ten-week Mario Bava film festival consisting of Paul Bond and me talking about ten of Mario Bava's films started back in March is still going. We had a few unplanned schedule changes, but it is remarkable to me we are actually still going. We wrap up with Rabid Dogs this week, and I wouldn;t be surprised if we do another ten Bava fims. This is just pure fun, and there is no pressure cause it's just Paul and I doing this stuff cause a) we love it, and b) we consider it experimenting for our distributed course True Crime (see next bullet ?? )    True Crime Freshman Seminar: Paul Bond and I are co-teaching a Freshman seminar at UMW that chronicles 300 years of True Crime using a variety of texts across numerous media. We are using Domain of One's Own (which all but one student had up and running in two days) and the students are an excitable bunch. We talked about the colonial execution narratives in yesterday's class, and the group is getting the hang of the blog. I spent sometime this evening build a Dynamic Course Calendar that I am imagining might capture all the prep notes for each class on a wiki. Reason being, starting next week groups of three students will lead the class discussions each week until week six when we actually create the first of three TV episodes on True Crime. This is one of the most ambitious class projects I've been a part of yet, and we're shooting for three half-hour TV episodes produced collectively by the end of the class. We'll see how this goes, and I plan on blogging about this far more extensively very soon.    Reclaim Your Domain: A fringe benefit of having folks like David Wiley, Jon Udell, Audrey Watters, Kin Lane, and Alan Levine in Fredericksburg for a weekend is that we can work on the Reclaim Your Domain project that got a started up at MIT last April. The idea is to get these folks in a room for a few hours over two days and see if we can't build on the beginnings of a loose, open source architecture for syndicating, archiving and managing one's distributed/fragmented work on the web. Obviously, this aligns with the early work Tim and I are doing with Reclaim Hosting, which is really the beginning of a larger movement to imagine what a syndication-orientated framework that's actually funded (hopefully as a Shuttleworth Fellowship project) might look like. It's a long time coming, and also quite exciting to think many of the issues we have been dealing with in the field over the last decade (eduglu anyone?) might actually result in something tangible that makes this stuff a bit more accessible for faculty and studetns alike. Isn't it hightime we finally had a few awesome thinkers in this realm together imagining some of this?  There's more, but I am gonna stop here because it is way past my bed time, and I already feel better knowing I got even a little about each of these out ? but I have much more to say about all of them. Anon.  "Jim Groom,"Domain of One's Own, Digital Liberal Arts, and the Popular Imagination",http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-digital-liberal-arts-and-the-popular-imagination/,9/6/2013,"When I saw UMW's Faculty and Staff Newsletter (a.k.a Eagle Eye) today, the top story was about the fact that UMW was being featured in Virginia Living magazine's 2013 Educational Supplement as one of Virginia's innovative schools. The two things responsible for getting UMW mentioned are Domain of One's Own and the Information Technology Convergence Center (which is coming online next year).  This is a very cool day for DTLT for a few reasons:  First, while we've been referenced by the Chronicle a number of times over the years for various projects, focus on the work we're doing in Virginia Living (the state's most popualr lifestyle magazine) suggests we're crossing over. More than just being seen as a fringe ""blog"" shop, the work we're doing is starting to impact the broader identity of UMW. We're becoming a mecca for innovative technologies when it comes to teaching and learning around the state for the average, not-so-tech-savvy Virginian.  Secondly, it also means the projects we frame and the metaphors we use to make them at once accessible and figuratively rich are resonating more widely. This is so important because the ideas we're trying to help people conceptualize are not necessarily intuitive. To be successful at this we have to be equal parts marketers, technologists, academics, and thinktank ? and we're all those and more ?? The work we're doing is developing amazing faculty, empowering students for the future, and capturing a broader imagination ? A-game through- and-through.  Finally, DTLT is helping UMW re-imagine itself in a generative way during a moment that more than a few schools are getting caught in the hype headlights of emerging technologies. We have a culture of high quality faculty across the disciplines experimenting with generative technologies as part and parcel of the work they do. This is not only a testament to our faculty, but it also enables UMW to start laying claim to a unique brand of the digital liberal arts. I think the digital liberal arts is ours to shape and define right now. Let's make the future we want, rather than accept the future we deserve.  Hmmm, so maybe that's what you get when you invest in good people over and above mediocre technologies. Interestingƒ..  "Jim Groom,Wrigley Ivy: Jack Bales on the Chicago Cubs,http://bavatuesdays.com/wrigley-ivy-jack-bales-on-the-chicago-cubs/,9/12/2013,"I've been meaning to write a post about Jack Bales's amazing work as part of the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative this past Spring, but somehow a post seemed inadequate. For more than three years now I've been bothering Jack, telling him he should get a domain to feature all the amazing research he does. An effort which resulted in his first domain: jackbales.com. And by no means was I pandering to Jack's ego (if he even has one), he has eight books under his belt, and his magnum opus ? a multi-volume tome on the history of the Chicago Cubs ? is being written presently. Jack is a titan amongst librarians, and a veritable icon at Mary Washington. He's been at UMW for 33 years now, and in addition to his copious research and stellar publication history, his work ethic with faculty and students on a day-to-day basis is the stuff of legend. Like Jack, I support faculty as part of my job here at UMW, so I have a very good idea how much time and energy goes into supporting more than thirty classes on average a semester ? it's Herculean. And on top of all this, Jack is possibly the most congenial, good-hearted, and downright awesome person working at UMW. And just about anyone in the UMW community would echo that sentiment. If I had a career like Jack's in my line of work, I would consider it a resounding success. He's a model for us all.  But enough of the Bales love, now we gotta get down to brass tacks. In this episode of DTLT Today Jack shares some of his recent research forays into a few colorful episodes from the Chicago Cubs' history. All of which are also published on his Cubs site Wrigley Ivy that he started as part of the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative. He uses that space to publish his research about a wide-range of Cubs history, including the dating of a poem about Tinker to Evers to Chance (a topic that got Jack's research into the Chicago Tribune), Willian Veeck Sr. (the basis of this article on Veeck in the baseball journal Nine as well as a forthcoming book), the Jurges and Waitkus shootings (which will be the fodder for a forthcoming ChicagoSide article), and the so-called curse of the billy goat (which Jack already turned into an article for ChicagoSide). And that's not even everything! All this is just the beginning of Jack's mammoth research work that will be published as a documentary history of the Cubs ? it's amazing to see someone get so deep into a labor so great. But Jack isn't only a font of facts, contexts, and anecdotes about the Chicago Cubs, he's also unbelievably enjoyable to talk to as the video will attest.  Unfortunately, Domain of One's Own can take no credit for Jack's unbelievable talents as a researcher and writer. However, we can argue it did connect him with a world of people, sources, and possibilities that might not have materialized otherwise. Every campus has their Jack Bales, the question is how can we help to augment these connections within and beyond their professional domains. I'm increasingly convinced that with Domain of One's Own UMW is at the very beginning stages of developing the richest network of teaching and learning we've yet to see on this campus and beyond ? and Jack's experience with this space is a wonderful illustration of it's amazing potential. Thanks Jack, I am a BIG FAN!!!  "Mark Sample,Teaching a Domain of One's Own with Reclaim Hosting,http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/teaching-a-domain-of-ones-own-with-reclaim-hosting/52279,9/19/2013,"One of the many things I'm excited about this semester is a new seminar called Hacking, Remixing, and Design. I'm trying a bunch of new ideas, including students registering their own web domains, which they'll use as home bases for the various digital projects we work on throughout the semester. The idea of a domain of one's own is nothing new ? the University of Mary Washington has had a domain program for students for several years now. What's new is the service I'm using: Reclaim Hosting.  Reclaim Hosting is a web hosting service for educators and students, providing simple one-click installation of a variety of web apps, including WordPress, Omeka, MediaWiki, and many others. Launched this summer by Jim Groom and Tim Owens ? the same folks behind the University of Mary Washington's domain program ? Reclaim Hosting is virtually free. The only cost to students is a $12 domain name registration fee. Reclaim Hosting's other expenses are, for now, covered by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation.  As Jim Groom explained to the Wired Campus blog when Reclaim Hosting was first announced,  > We're providing a space and platform where people can learn how to code. Understanding conceptually how Web hosting works is an important skill in the 21st century.  And indeed, the one-click installation of popular web applications is only part of what Reclaim Hosting offers its users. Each domain includes secure FTP access, an email account, the ability to run Cron jobs (which execute scripts and programs at regular intervals), and SSH/Shell Access, meaning students can work on the command line, programming in Perl and Python. In short, students get all the benefits of a typical shared server hosting service (say, Dreamhost) for the cost of several slices of pizza.  As both Jim and Tim will admit, Reclaim Hosting is an experiment. It may not be around forever. But then again, neither will many of the other online services we use. (Ahem, Google Wave, Google Reader, Google Video, Catch, Tungle, etc. & etc.) What's different with Reclaim Hosting is that it's incredibly easy to backup your entire site and take it with you to any other hosting service that uses cPanel as its admin interface (and that's a lot of them).  But enough about the tech side of things. What about the pedagogical value of a domain of one's own? I'll share some of my own ideas in a future ProfHacker post, but I'm interested in hearing about ? and maybe borrowing ? your ideas!

Steve Covello (@apescience) September 17, 2013  I was prepared to read about a premium suite of plugins that I could buy for the privilege, but was pleasantly surprised to find Chris Knowles's post ""How to Publish to Multiple WordPress Sites from a Single Install"" to be a thoughtful, clear, and beautifully documented articulation of how the spoke/hub model for pushing content from one site out to another works more generally in Content Management Systems, but for the purposes of his example in WordPress in particular.  At first I was interested in this post to start showing faculty and students alike how they can use their WordPress sites to push content out to a number of different social media services like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc., but still keep their own version of everything they publish. That, for example, is one relatively simple and powerful reason to use such a spoke and hub model, you are the hub that pushes content out to the various spaces around the web you want it to appear.  But as we got talking in DTLT about this model at 9:30 this morning, it started to get much more interesting. In particular, the plugin that is pushing ones posts, images, videos, etc. in WordPress to all these different sites (what I'll affectionately called ""the pusher"") is <del>Push Syndication</del> Syndicate out [Update: Tim and Martha tried Push Syndication but couldn;t get it to work so went with a similar plugin Syndicate Out]. One way to think about this plugin is it is does the absolute opposite thing then FeedWordPress, rather then pulling RSS feeds in, it uses XML-RPC to push content out. So, as Marx did to Hegel, DTLT is doing to distributed course blogs ? we're standing syndication on its head ?? Rather than insisting on making the course the hub as has been the case with ds106 (and scores of courses sites on UMW Blogs over the years), why not decentralize the syndication and allow each of the sites to push their content to the hub. Same effect, jut a different approach.  But why? What are the benefits? 1) it is techncially inline with the ethos of giving the students more control over their work; they can control the syndication in this regard because ""the pusher"" plugin is installed on their blog. 2) It is far simpler than FeedWordPress for faculty to get up and running with ? you don't have to ask faculty to load in tens of feed URLs for the syndication engine to work. 3) It's immediate, with XML-RPC, there is no wait for the post to show up. Publishing on the course hub is immediate. 4) It allows for both students and faculty alike to become a hub or a spoke. When I was at the Reclaim Open hackathon at the MIT Media Lab in April Kin Lane was conceptualizing the Reclaim Your Domain around this idea. 5) Less load on the server CPU pulling 100s feeds as weas the case in ds106, in this model you decenter that to a distributd push. 6) The whole process can be automated to some great degree on both the Reclaim Hosting and the Domain of One's Own server thanks to Installatron. Tim Owens did a mock-up of what this might look like for students and faculty alike.  When going through the process of installing a WordPress site in Installatron (pictured above), we can actually build in a dropdown list of courses that you want to publish to from your own site. Martha Burtis, who has been working on the idea of packaging WordPress plugins suites in Installatron already, is seeing if we can't get the Syndicate Out plugin to not only get automatically installed and activiated on the student (or spoke) blog, but also identify the hub it will be publishing to based on the dropdown selction. If a student or faculty member choses to create a course on the fly by selecting that option and then naming it accordingly, it will immediately populate in the dropdown along with a unique identifier. Instantaneously it will allow others to subscribe to it seamlessly. All of this with no mention of RSS! EDUGLU heresy, and I love it!  Thinking out loud here, what Howard Rheingold labored through for his Social Media Issues site, which admittedly is awesome, could be accomplished at the server level with next to no overhead. This is the in-a-box that we actually need to make synidcation course practical in highered. It is a bit hazy here for me (as much of it is right now), but I think we can manage copy all the login information from the student blogs into the hub at the level of Installatron by grabbing their username and password and copying them to the hub database. In other words, every student and faculty in such an environment becomes a spoke and/or hub, the idea of the motherblog becomes deprecated and we start to move toward a more decentered approach wherein each learner can control what syndicates where.  And this is just the beginning, this model would also allow students with a Domain of One's Own blog at UMW to use the Syndicate Out plugin to seamlessly send their posts out to any UMW Blogs blog they're an author of. We tried it out today, and it's absolutely seamless. You can see the spoke post here and the hub republishing on jimgroom.umwblogs.org here. So cool.  We still have a lot to figure out with all this, but as we were talking about it today we started recognizing the fact that Domain of One's Own has already given way to Reclaim Hosting, Installatron plugins and theme packages, and now a whole new way of approaching spoke/hub syndication models for courses. And I firmly believe this is just the beginning of a whole new level of re- conceptualization, experimentation, and innovation ? we're just now realizing that Domain of One's Own is more than just giving everyone a domain, WordPress blog, portfolio site, etc. ?  it's quickly beginning to feel like a paradigm shift for what's possible when it comes to digital publishing at UMW and beyond. It's actually kinda hard to explain just how exciting it is to go to work these days ? my head is constantly buzzing, it's almost hard to think, no less concentrate, on anything else. DTLT is in the zone right nowƒ.  "Jim Groom,Reclaim the Chronicle,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-the-chronicle/,9/20/2013,"Mark Sample wrote a really good post laying out what Reclaim Hosting is all about on ProfHacker yesterday. He lays out the nuts and bolts of what something like this means:  > Reclaim Hosting is a web hosting service for educators and students, providing simple one-click installation of a variety of web apps, including WordPress, Omeka, MediaWiki, and many othersƒ.And indeed, the one-click installation of popular web applications is only part of what Reclaim Hosting offers its users. Each domain includes secure FTP access, an email account, the ability to run Cron jobs (which execute scripts and programs at regular intervals), and SSH/Shell Access, meaning students can work on the command line, programming in Perl and Python. In short, students get all the benefits of a typical shared server hosting service (say, Dreamhost) for the cost of several slices of pizza.  I'm a big fan of pizza, so I love that closing analogy. One of the other things we've started realizing recently thanks to Martha Burtis's work on creating customized packages using ""Installatron"" (an aptly named application installer) is that we can start offering particular WordPress installations that are customized to be out-of-the-box solutions to something like course syndication. The idea that faculty and/or students can deploy a fully- functioning syndicated course hub in seconds is really exciting. This is an idea we're working though currently at DTLT, and you can see the early stages of thinking through this here. This approach is done with WordPress, and it populates free plugins and some custom code that enables students to automatically push their work to the course hub.  And while some might balk at the automation of this, it by no means precludes anyone from hacking away, building their own, or taking this in a bold new direction. What this does is makes the syndicated course setup that much more seamless for faculty to use, which I ïve found makes a huge difference in their willingness to experiment with such an option. The fact that the experimentation with this through Domain of One's own has made such an idea possible already justifies this project, but add to that the fact that we are using Reclaim Hosting as a way to make these possibilities available to as many faculty and students as possible is downright awesome.  Another feature I'm beginning to explore in the True Crime Freshman Seminar with the students, all of whom have their own web host and domain as part of UMW's Domain of One's Own, is being able to help them manage their web hosting by being able to access their cPanels (see image above). With this setup I can act as a server admin for all of their sites and help them out with issues that in the past I found difficult to resolve when teaching ds106. I can help them trouble shoot DNS issues, installation problems, plugin snafus, databases problems, etc. If you're using Reclaim Hosting as a way to show your students how to manage web hosting, maintain their own space online, and get familiar with the affordances of web hosting ? this is one possibility for enabling some powerful support. That said, you might want to let them know as much, becuase with great power comes great responsibility.  "Jim Groom,The Long History of Domain of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-long-history-of-domain-of-ones-own/,9/22/2013,"I found this image on the Tumblr ""One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op"" which consists of random images taken from an archive of Geocities sites. It's part of the Geocities research blog run by Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied. According to the Tumblr description:  > Screenshots are automatically generated from a stash of old Geocities home pages, rescued by the Archive Team in 2009. The files are processed from oldest to newest.  I love this kind of stuff, and when I saw this screenshot I couldn't help but think that the Domain of One's Own project is part of a long history of faculty and students alike creating ""homepages"" on the web. Geocities was the old gold equivalent of helping people get up and running making a site, learning some absic HTML, FTPing files to a server, and generally understanding how the whole web thing works. I had my own Geocities site I back in 1994 that was dedicated to American Modernist literature. That was my first experience with writing on the web. The tools have come a long way in many respects over the last decade, but the idea is basically the same. Everything that is old is new again.  "Jim Groom,Where have the Online Neighborhoods Gone?,http://bavatuesdays.com/where-have-the-online-neighborhoods-gone/,9/22/2013,"After linking to the ""One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op"" Tumblr in my last post, I started reading around a bit on the Geocities research blog. This post by Olia Lialina (pioneer web artist and theorist) about Neocities got me thinking a lot about how we are framing Domain of One's Own here at UMW. Neocities is a project by Kyle Drake to ""help me keep the creative, independent internet alive!"" and it's built in the spirit of Geocities. Lialina has some deeply insightful observations that she jotted down as soon as the service went public this Summer that I'm finding helpful to think more broadly about building community around DoOO.  We have the basic hosting worked out, we're currently exploring more sophisticated syndication, but we still need to figure out how to imagine community more broadly. In this regard I think the same is true for Reclaim Hosting ? in order for both to be more than just hosting they have to be able to expose what's happening around the community.  As she was testing out Neocities soon after its launch, Lialina notes thatƒ.  > There are still people out there who can write HTML, want to have their homepages made by hand and want to express themselves through HTML code. What seems lost is the idea (or skill) to make links to each other, manually, to build anything outside of your own ""profile"". Neocities users do not link to other users' pages, except user youpi and myself.  This idea of isolation in managing one's own site is a theme that recurs through the first impressions. What's more, I think it's also apparent for anyone who has been blogging for a while. The slow death of the blogosphere is just that, the cultural amnesia that links between sites and people is what makes the web. Like with syndication, we want this to happen as a part of a siloed service like Facebook or LinkedIn ? the idea of a personal profile seems almost divorced from the social self online ? and that is something we need to challenge with DoOO.  There is also a discussion about the changing rhetoric around Geocities over time. In 1996 and 2004 Geocities was referred to as a priosonhouse of one's content. Free web hosting services like Geocities ""were seen as a prison for creativity and self expression."" There was a push to controlling your own webspace through commodity web hosting services like Bluehost and the like. But the rhetoric around Neocities, an updated verion of Geocities in many ways, is framed by Kyle Drake as aƒ.  > ƒ.place for the users to be ""in complete control of the content and presentation they provide to their audience"". It is of course an over-over- statement. However, compared to the industrialized nothingness Facebook offers, any ""pimp my profile"" service can be regarded as offering ""complete control"".  This is fascianting to me because the critiquing of Geocities in 1996 and 2004 was not so much about ownership as it was about ease of use. For the replacement was not cheap commodity web hosting for most folks, but rather ""the industrialized nothingness Facebook offers."" So much so that something like a simple, third-party service for hosting HTML pages seems like the second coming of Freedom online. What an interesting shift in the rhetoric of the web over the last 15 years or so. There's a dissertation in that alone.  But what is most interesting and useful for me in her early impressions is the fact that Neocities is cultivating a series of disconnected sites that don't foster community. No one is linking to anyone else, and that frames the ""beginning of the end.""  > Very bad move: Calling it Neocities and not starting with neighborhoods. When Yahoo bought Geocities, they only offered vanity profiles and discontinued neighborhoods and suburbs. Users became isolated, it was the beginning of the end.  How do we build neighborhoods in DoOO and Reclaim Hosting? Is it around topics? -interests? -academic disicplines? -academic departments? -courses? -people? I imagine some combination of all these will be the case? And the more I think about it the more the idea of rolling out DoOO by a class of students, i.e. freshamn, didn't make all that much sense for the project. The success of DoOO is going to depend as much on academic programs, courses, departments, and individuals ? and like everything else we've done at UMW it will depend on an organic push. I'm just wondering what the idea of ""neighborhoods"" looks like for DoOO and how we might start experimenting along those lines.  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own: a Toolkit for User Innovation,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-a-toolkit-for-user-innovation/,10/5/2013,"I've been asked the following question a lot over the last year:  > What's the difference between UMW Blogs and Domain of One's Own?  Why build and support something like Domain of One's Own when you already have UMW Blogs? I've previously gone about answering this question by discussing the differences in terms of the limits of a centrally hosted version of WordPress in the case of UMW Blogs, etc. But that's really missing the point, the difference has nothing to do with WordPress, per se. That fact became crystal clear to me after seeing this tweet from Jon Udell:  > They think I made a tool. I think I made a toolkit for user innovation. (http://t.co/nmNq7z6QFr) Need to sort that out.  >  >  ?  Jon Udell (@judell) October 3, 2013  Udell continues to be one of the most subtley profound thinkers in the edtech space ? a field tangential, at best, to his work as a Microsoft researcher ? in that he deeply understands how essential it is to understand technologies, to graft a concept by Anton Chekov from a literary to a technical context, as ""potentiality."" The idea that within the use of every technical tool there's more than just the consciousness of that tool, but also the possibility to spark something beyond those predefined uses. The only real way to galvanize that potentiality is to provide the conditions of possibility ? a toolkit for user innovation like Domain of One's Own.  UMW Blogs is a powerful tool for publishing on campus, and I don't want to minimize its impact at UMW over the years. Hundreds of people have found ways to use it beyond a blog, effectively re-imagining its potential by pushing it beyond any predefined limits. At the same time though, UMW Blogs was not necessarily an open ended toolkit for user innovation, it was specifically a tool to scale the publishing on campus to as many people as possible. And that's why seven years later Domain of One's Own is necessary at UMW. This is a space that we can freely offer every student and faculty member as a fullblown toolkit for innovation that they are the master of, so to speak. A step beyond UMW Blogs in that it empowers anyone at UMW to build something like UMW Blogs.  That's the thing, Domain of One's Own is remarkable because it gives everyone in our community the toolkit to build and innovative around their own community publishing platform, or a million other tools we haven't yet dreamed of. What's more, it is not tool specific. Unlike UMW Blogs, Domain of One's Own is not all about WordPress because it's a platform for installing a wide range of open source tools, or even a techncial environment for going about building your own. It's a garage of sorts ?? I was recently asked by a UMW Bullet reporter if I thought UMW Blogs was somehow threatened by the presence of Domain of One's Own, and rather than being threatened the later is the apotheosis of the former.  So, suffice it to say that I'm more than excited that Udell is coming to the ""Minding the Future"" event here at UMW in little more than a week. I'm wondering if he'll be working through this idea of the user innovation toolkit and what that might mean in a context that explores the future of technically framed education. I'm not sure folks fully comprehend just how epic ""Minding the Future"" will be! Udell is just one of five of the awesome folks coming to down to lay it down!  "Christopher Long,A Domain of Your Own,http://www.cplong.org/2013/10/a-domain-of-your-own/,10/7/2013,"As a graduate student in the digital age, you need a domain of your own.  First of all, you will be Googled, and when you are, your domain should appear early in the results as the fulcrum of a carefully cultivated online identity.  Second, in order to leverage the power of the social web to cultivate a community of scholars interested in your work, you need a domain to which to point your friends on Facebook, your followers on Twitter, and those who have circled you on Google+.  In thinking about your online presence as a graduate student or academic, it is helpful to conceive of it as a kind of ecosystem in which various elements work together to offer the public a picture of who you are and the work you are doing.  A canonical website ? a domain of your own ? should provide the essential nutrients of your online ecosystem. To create one, register your name or, if you have a relatively common name, register a unique name that identifies you across a wide spectrum of websites. It is not too expensive to register a domain name with a service like Blue Host, for example. Even if you decide to host your site somewhere else, it is important to register your domain so you have some control over your online identity.  Once you have a website setup under your domain, consider it the place in which you document your research, write reflectively on your scholarship, and invite others to discover your work. You might also use the site to curate content about a hobby of interest so as to give people a more well rounded sense of who you are. At minimum, anything you would put on your CV should be added your website and amplifed through various social media channels.  Depending on your area of research, one social media channel might be more important than another. There is a robust and influential community of Digital Humanists on Twitter, for example; while Academic.edu seems to be emerging as a kind of Linkedin for academics.  In this regard, Google Plus has a special role to play. Even if you are not very active on Google Plus, it is worth creating a profile and posting your work there because Google is beginning to integrate G+ into its core business operations, and specifically search. Once you create a G+ profile, you should link it to your domain. This allows Google to associate your G+ profile with the content you author on your site so they are able to serve information about you up with links they present in search results. When it's set up, this is what is looks like in Google Search:  Here you can see the way information about you as author is connected with content you wrote to authenticate both the value of the link and your status as author. Once this connection is established, you will be better able to control the content associated with your name when a potential employer or an interested student or colleague Googles you to find out more about your work.  ### Resources     Jim Groom has been a leader in advocating for every student and faculty to have a domain of their own. He talks about the Domain of One's Own project he developed at the University of Mary Washington on this podcast with the Chronicle of Higher Education.    This collaborative guest post on the Prof. Hacker blog written by Miriam Posner (@miriamkp), Stewart Varner (@stewartvarner) and Brian Croxall (@briancroxall) on Creating Your Web Presence: A Primer for Academics is very helpful.  #### Tags:  DomainGraduate EducationSocial MediaTwitter  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own: Notes from the Trailing Edge,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-notes-from-the-trailing-edge/,10/18/2013,"Image credit: Giulia Forsythe's ""Domain of One's Own by @jimgroom #TEDxUSagrado #viznotes""  This morning I was fortunate enough to present at the first university sponsored TEDX event in Puerto Rico hosted at the Universidad del Sagrado CorazÑn and organized by Antonio Vantaggiato and Doribel Rodriguez. It was a remarkable event, and bit of a UMW/ds106 homecoming given I was joined by the likes of Gardner Campbell, Alan Levine, and Giulia Forsythe over the last few days.  My presentation was based on the idea of ""trailing edge"" technologies and the open web that Jon Udell blogged about last week. The basic idea is that the innovations Udell's become known for weren't necessarily cutting edge technologies, but rather a series of old gold web-based technolgoies and open formats that have been around for a while (just like Grant Potter did with the technology behind ds106radio). In fact, there's a lot about what Udell is saying about the trailing edge approach that is enabled by the open web that is true about ds106: blogs, wikis, GIFs, ds106radio, etc. But, alas, this 18 minute presentation didn't touch on ds106 given it couldn't begin to do it justice.  As far as how I thought the talk went, I think the energy and excitement were there, and I refused to go by a script, as usual, but I had written this one out in advance ? something I rarely do ? and I think the written version was better than what I presented. I tried to rehearse it enough times before I went so that what I wrote would become natural, but given this was a brand new presentation, and I hadn't presented it before, I omitted quite a bit of what I wrote down. I also think it was significantly less than 18 minutes, but I'm not certain of that.  Presenting to a crowd like this is both a rush and a bit alienating because you can't really see anyone. I tend to work off visual cues and body language in the audience to get a sense if what I'm doing is connecting, that was impossible for me this morning. I have to beleive by presentation suffers as a result because my energy feeds off the response either way. What's more, I aim my talks to entertain first and foremost, but this one was a bit more serious and not nearly as playful as my last TEDx in NYC. I might rethink that in the future if I ever do a more performative presentation with this kind of format. Anyway, below are my slides as well as the original script I came up with.  I'm not sure if anyone got the oblique allusion, but It's a nod to Virginia Woolf, in particular the argument in her extended essay ""A Room of One's Own,"" wherein she argues that women writers need both a literal and figural space within a literary tradition dominated by men.  The group I work with at University of Mary Washington (the division of Teaching and Learning Technologies) has both borrowed and modified this idea, with all apologies to Virginia Woolf, to refer to an online space that is both virtual and real.  And that's exactly what UMW is doing, we are offering every student and faculty member their own domain and web hosting. Now let me be clear about what I mean by a domain?  A domain is both a quotidian and metaphysical at once. Quotidian in that it acts as an address and metaphysical in that it's the act of naming something. The prospect of bringing new knowledge into being on the web.  What do I mean by web hosting?  And while the possibilities have grown exponentially with open source applications, I'm not here today to share a particularly novel idea or to ""blow your mind"" with thing you could never have imagined otherwise. We've had some version of personal publishing for a long while nowƒ  And even the amazing affordances of commodity web hosting are not all that new ? it's been around for more than a decade even though it still seems radical to most universities. In fact, I imagine many of you not only recognize the value of having these spaces, but already have them yourselves.  And before before we started DoOO our students and faculty did as well.  So what I am here to communicate this morning is that our various educational institutions (K12, secondary, post-secondary, etc.) have no real way of engaging its community in those spaces, no less helping them understand the rich possibilities there.  Fact is, often times the IT infrastructure at institutions of learning and beyond are far too monolithic and inflexible to embrace what the web is, no less who we are on it.  Which is truly a shame because rather than being thought of as a threat to what's possible.  A forward thinking IT infrastructure (which would be fairly loose, fast, and cheap using open standards of syndication) would work to connect these various individuals into a network, creating serendipitous connections that taken together reflect the rich tapestry of who the people are that make up any institution.  Mention of rainbows and unicorns goes over flat, I think, it was even animated ??  As a technologist and long-time advocate for the open web Jon Udell noted in a recent blog post titled ""MOOCs need to be user innovation toolkits"" many of the ideas and innovations he's best known for happened on the ""trailing edge"" of the web, rather than the leading edge.  He notes that his early work with screencasting in 2004 and 2005 was using tools that had long been available to capture video of software in action. What he demonstrated is how it could be powerful for communicating with others, and that's when it took off.  The work he is doing now to aggregate iCal feeds (not the Apple product but a file format that enables internet users to send other users calendar requests) is yeoman's work that is trying to get institutions and individuals to think more closely about how they can better share what's happening through accessible calendar feeds that have open standards.  He notes the reason he keeps finding novel uses for these trailing-edge technologies, because they are not closed, disposable products or services, but rather they are ""User Innovation Toolkits"" which is a phrase he borrows from Eric von Hippel's book ""Democratizing Innovation.""  And which gets at the idea that the web is not the sum total of the next monolithic innovation from Silicon Valley, but rather a series of small, distributed revolutions that occur as we, the people, adapt and extend these products and services as a result of open standards the web is premised on.  This is exactly what UMW's Domain of One's Own is philosophically grounded in. Giving every student, staff, and faculty their own User Innovation Toolkit so that they can fully understand the principles of the web. Interrogate its limits, and extend its possibilities.  In many ways Domain of One's Own is also on the trailing edge, for more than 15 years universities and colleges have given faculty, staff and students a place to understand the web ? even if in a relatively limited capacity.  Remember when universities had ""Tilda Spaces"" ? those arcane webpages that no one would update for six years? Few universities even maintain these spaces any more, and have have done little or nothing to update them so that they reflect the possibilities of the web today, no less thinking about how they might be crucial for teaching and learning.  It's a lost opportunity!  For me that is what Domain of One's Own is, an effort to update these spaces, rethink them in light of today's open web. Give people more than just HTML editing privileges, let them install a wide array of applications, understand how web servers work, and struggle with DNS in addition to HTML.  Let them explore the innovation toolkit, let them build things we could only imagine, let them dream in electric sheep. To quote Gardner Campbell's ""Personal Cyberinfrastructure,"" isn't it time we let students, faculty, and staff alike become ""sysadmins of their own education?""  "Jim Groom,Reclaim Your Domain: Honing the Vision,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-your-domain-honing-the-vision/,10/20/2013,"I have a ton to write about because this past week was pretty intense. The Minding the Future event on Monday, OpenVA on Tuesday, travel to Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a workshop at the Universidad del Sagrado Corazon on Thursday (alongside Gardner Campbell and Alan Levine), capped off with a TEDx talk Friday morning. Amazingly everything went pretty well and like Brian Lamb notes with uncharacteristic optimism (his may not last ?? ), I'm about as optimistic about the field of EdTech as I've been in a long while.  This may be a myopic vision taken more globally, but I'm not necessarily working at 30,000 feet. I'm on the ground alongside a group of people who together are trying to make a difference in the distributed spaces within which they live and work ? and in that regard I'm truly optimistic. Here at DTLT we've kept the course, remained true to a shared ethos (as Mike Caulfield points out brilliantly here), and we're starting to reap some of benefits of that. All that said, this post isn't about any of that. Fact is, I'm going to need several separate posts to try and cover the various events listed above to try and explain this optimism. this one won't begin to cover any of those events.  This post is about yet another event we had earlier this week with a number of the participants in Minding the Future. We were lucky enough to have Audrey Watters, Kin Lane, Davide Wiley, and Alan Levine in town last Monday, and we took the occasion to revisit the idea of Reclaim Your Domain that Audrey, Kin, and I started mapping out at M.I.T. in April. This is an idea I think has a lot of potential, and both Audrey and Kin remain interested in the possibilities ? so we took about three hours Monday morning, along with Tim Owens, Ryan Brazell, Andy Rush, Scott Lockman, Bill Smith, Martha Burtis, Robin2Go, and Shelley Keith (in my organizing haze I forgot to tell Tom Woodward, but thankfully he still caught the tail end of the discussion).  The rest of this post will be an attempt to try and capture some of what we talked about (unfortunately there was no recording), interpret some of the scribblings in the image above, and generally ask for feedback, clarification, and correction from anyone who was there, or even folks who were not!  Reclaim Your Domain: A Breakdown of the Discussion    The discussion started with me setting up the three different parts of Reclaim that have begin to emerge. As well as hedging about the name, which Wiley scolded me for, can you believe that?! Anyway, the first branch of Reclaim is Reclaim Hosting. This is a hosting service that Tim Owens and I spun up as part of the Shuttleworth Fellowship that gives faculty and staff affordable hosting and domains so that they can begin to explore with establishing their web presence, or bringing their presence on a distributed set of third party applications into one space they control. We talked about the idea of packages using Installatron to enable people to create quick, customized installs. For example, a portfolio package through Installatron for WordPress, or a customized syndication hub for WordPress, etc. The possibilities are myriad, but this is first and foremost affordable hosting that could scale to the institution level to not only support students and faculty, but also entire institutions that can't run this internally for whatever reason. It's basically DTLT's effort to package up the work we've done with DoOO and provide it to any other educational institution that's interested. This branch of reclaim is fairly stable right now, and while the other two branches will serve to buttress and augment this branch, in many ways it's the most straight forward of the three.  The second branch is Reclaim Learning, and this is the social, community branch of Reclaim. Here we'll be focusing on how we can start to bring a community of folks together to start sharing their work. How are you using your various spaces to build out your course site, what are people teaching, could this be a place to share tutorials, approaches, and more generally create a space where open, distributed EdTech can happen. A place where faculty and students alike can come to get help, ideas, and a sense of what it's all about. This is all about bringing folks together to help one another. How this works and what this looks like is not entirely clear to me, but it has a lot in common with what we are trying to do more generally for the state of Virginia as part of OpenVA, so this is an ideas many of us will be coming back to. We didn't spend too much time on this part last Monday, but that's because most of our energy was focused on the final element.  The third and final branch, Reclaim Your Domain, is where Kin, Audrey and I started six months prior, and I think we started getting a much better idea of what this is all about. This part of the puzzle is an open source project that basically enables you reclaim, archive, synchronize, and personally centralize your distributed, online presence on the web. This is the idea that started the whole thing, grounded in work D'Arcy Norman and Boone Gorges started a while back. I think we started to fine tune this, we'll be creating a meta- layer application that will enable you to have an API marketplace (something Kin Lane has been conceptualizing and proto-typing) for a wide variety of web services (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, WordPress.com, Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) that will allow you to archive, synchronize, and seamlessly move your data between a variety of storage spaces (i.e. your web host, Amazon S3, DropBox, GitHub, etc.). What's more, each of these will have a slick wizard (like the awesome open source profect OpenPhoto is doing with Trovebox) that will enable you to do this easily and have context specific interface that will also educate folks on what to do, how to do it, and why it's important. Inline knowledge, so to speak.  The idea came up that the interface for accomplishing this would be similar to If This Than That but abstracted out a layer.  During the discussion David Wiley pushed a bit harder on why this is even important, you can see the beginnings of that list list in the center of the image:     Historical Internet Archive    Web Literacy (End User and development)    Self presentation and preservation    Flips the web back to the personal, self-determination    About the people, scaling the possibilities of the individual to more easily control their small piece of the web  The idea came up that this would lead to no more freak outs, if there is another Posterous-like shutdown or if Facebook changes their terms for the millionth time you don't to freakout again. You have agency, you can simply pull your data out. What's more, with the API marketplace in play that we were talking about, you could convert your Posterous data into a Tumblr, WordPress, etc. Now the hook into these various applications is something we talked about at length, and I am going to leaver the specifics to folks smarter than me, but as I understand it this will provide an interface to hook into those various applications ? an open source, self-hosted control panel for managing your online presence.  One of the points that Kin Lane brought up tin terms of the larger why was that web literacy is crucial and he used the domain he is (was?) working in, the Federal Government, as an example. To negotiate anything from voting to financial aid to welfare to health care you will need to be web literate. As more and more of these social services go on line, the more we will need to understand how these spaces work, have access and control over this data, and ensure that we're working to educate the folks who need to know how it works most. I loved that idea, and it abstracted well beyond education. In that regard, reclaim your domain is bigger than that ? it is starts to possibly frame a blueprint for a kind of federal digital strategy on an individual basis ? something like this has to be coming sooner or later. All of us want some way to start thinking about how we will manage, archive, and share the digital resources we have been creating, collecting, and sharing over the last twenty years, and this will all get more important as time goes on. In many ways this branch of reclaim the most exciting to me.  As far as the web literacy part, Audrey mentioned that Mark Surman and Doug Belshaw are already working with this at Mozilla (as I am sure many folks are) and it's time to start reaching out and making those connections. What is their approach? How can we use it? help build it? Etc. Luckily Alan Levine will be going to a Mozilla event in London next week, and we can start that relationship sooner rather than later.  In the end I guess this is why I feel hopeful, I feel like there is a possible plan that abstracts out beyond any one tool or our narrow domain of education, yet allows us to hone in on the processes and projects we are already part of. Reclaim Your Domain is in many ways born out of Domain of One's Own in my mind, but in this context it is far broader, in both its appeal and potential to promote principles of the open web, empower users to gain a deeper understanding of those principles, and, most importantly, inspire us within the edtech field to start thinking beyond our domain in order to make it that much better.  "Tim Owens,Building a Community from UMW Domains,https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-community-from-umw-domains/,10/23/2013,"Martha Burtis and I have had a burst of energy in the past week developing on some ideas surrounding the Domain of One's Own project and I wanted to start to get some of it out there. It's amazing how one idea can lead to a discovery which can ignite a fire of development. I have so much to share about how far we've come in the past week at building a community around this project and there's still much more that feels possible based on the work we've done. I'm sure Martha will be writing a few posts of her own regarding some of it and I have no doubt that what we're doing is setting the stage for Domain of One's Own as a completely rethought learning platform for the web. I've written a few posts about the nuts and bolts framework of building the Domain of One's Own environment. At it's roots it's a LAMP web hosting environment running cPanel. One of the more powerful features for us has been the move to using Installatron which is an automated software installation plugin (if the names Simple Scripts or Fantastico are familiar to you imagine that but much nicer) that provides our faculty and students with a simple installer for a variety of open source software. We can monitor much of what gets installed and by whom on the server but in many ways this is a black box that requires a login as an admin to get at. Drawing more detailed analytics about how our users are taking advantage of the platform have been much more difficult and ultimately we wanted to find ways to expose the activity happening amongst our community in better ways. I'm really excited to start sharing with you some of the things we've done towards that end.The Domain of One's Own project consists of a few different use-cases, one of them being a curricular focus where a faculty member will wish to work with their students who would sign up to get their domains and the building of the site becomes a component of the course. We have new faculty member, Lance Gentry, in Marketing that heard about the project and wanted to use it with a cohort of students to help them understand the power of a professional portfolio as it relates to social media and marketing. As a resource Martha setup this directory of sites for him last week to so he'd have a quick way of seeing what his students had done and have quick access. Most of that directory is created manually but Martha did find a plugin called WP-Thumbnail that tied into Wordpress.com's free website thumbnail service to provide dynamic screenshots based on URLs. I thought it was a great looking site and resource for that faculty member and wondered if we'd be able to create something like that for all sites on the server. Once I started digging around I found that Installatron uses a SQLite database that had every install stored in it. Converting that information to a CSV was a breeze using SQLite Database Browser and I quickly saw it had a lot of powerful information in it including who had installed the software, what the software was, and the URL. I setup a custom post type called ""Sites"" in our main Wordpress install at http://umwdomains.com and created a taxonomy for it called ""Software"". I also setup custom fields to store the URL and the installation date. I also grabbed our user database from WHMCS which we use for signups and brought them all in as users to the Wordpress site so I could associate the Site posts with the various users. After I imported all the data in I immediately saw that we could get some great information using the power of Wordpress. Take for example the taxonomy page for Software, which now showed us a quick breakdown of all software installs by the numbers and through which we could get lists of all sites using a particular piece of software:  We knew another type of taxonomy we'd want to check against was the course list, which would allow us to dynamically generate the same type of directory Martha had created for Gentry's course across any course using UMW Domains. I added the Courses taxonomy in there, populated with the courses we knew were using the project, and then Martha and I manually went through the list of sites we had in those courses and applied the taxonomy to them. We have relied heavily in the past on Types and Views (now called Toolset) which is a suite of plugins that allows us to customize the types of information that get stored in Wordpress and how to view it on the frontend. I used the Views plugin to put together a quick directory page that would paginate through every install making use of the dynamic thumbnails and the user's first and last name based on the Author of the site post. Martha added a filter to the top that would allow us to filter by course. And now all of a sudden we've built a dynamic directory of all installs on the server, sorted in order of most recent install and filterable by any criteria we want to create. You can view that directory here and see how this can quickly become a powerful way of discovering interesting things happening in Domain of One's Own.  But this is just the start. In my next few posts I'll talk about how we built in the ability for this directory to update with all new installs, how we're using Feedwordpress to dynamically pull in and link back to all posts across all sites including categories and tags, how we've automated the creation of new courses in the system (which relates closely to the hub/spoke model Jim blogged about a few weeks ago, and some approaches we're considering to allowing users to become integrated into the community and control the content that gets shared across it. We're quickly putting together a community hub and finding Wordpress is the perfect platform to feed in all of the activity happening on the server across all the various domains and feature that work in a central place. I'm fired up by the possibilities this affords us.  "Jim Groom,A Place of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-place-of-ones-own/,10/28/2013,"UMW's President Rick Hurley  The University of Mary Washington's President Hurley published another article in the education section of The Huffington Post the week before last titled ""A Place of One's Own  ?  Online."" This article builds on an earlier post published at the beginning of the month (which I already discussed here on the bava) that is part of a larger series about the ""intersection of technology and pedagogy at colleges of the liberal arts and sciences.""  This installment frames how UMW is not approaching instructional technologies as an afterthought, but rather is working to integrate it into the very fabric of the teaching and learning experience. This has been the case with UMW Blogs for more than six years, and the rollout of Domain of One's Own is building upon that. The article frames Domain of One's Own in the following ways:  > The Domain of One's Own initiative urges and coaches our students to set up their own individual websites. The initiative was propelled by several related ideas: The first was that students could use their sites to host, show, and promote their scholarship and research. The websites could serve as digital portfolios showcasing the students' resumes and best academic work for potential employers. And students would carry these URLs with them well beyond graduation. Second, the very act of building a website would be a great learning experience ? it would allow students to grapple with how things are created on the web. And it would teach students how to create websites for others, an important and marketable skill. Third, for those whose ideas really take flight, the student domains would be the digital presentation of themselves, a way to explore their digital identities. They would not just be a marketing tool but a way for students and graduates to put their ideas, thoughts, writing, poetry, music, and videos, out there for others to contemplate, to respond to, or just enjoy.  I think all of these are true, and the idea of Domain of One's Own as an e-portfolio is something Stephen Downes notes as well recently, but I think this is only a small part of what it can be. What makes Domain of One's Own so remarkable is that it also becomes a user innovation toolkit (as Mike Caulfield contextualizes and builds on brilliantly here) that expands well beyond simply showing off what you've done, it can also become the future possible of what you can and will do.  What's even cooler is this isn't limited to the students, the same has been true for UMW's Division of Teaching and learning Technologies. Just take a peek over at Tim Owens's latest post on the work he and Martha Burtis are doing to re-think how we build a community framework from this distributed cosmos of sites to expose the amazing work happening around campus. These ideas are driven by exploring the myriad possibilities of Domain of One's Own, not simply settling for a new eportfolio system because that kind of limited thinking is what hamstrings most groups.  What's more, Martha Burtis eloquently frames this process in her most recent post by explaining how Domain of One's Own pushes the work our group is doing to new levels by helping us let go a little, understand how the technology can and will be used by our community, and then developing around that. As she notes:  > I think we actually plan too much and we try to engineer our projects and systems too tightly. I'm not advocating for a completely irresponsible approach to tech innovation in education, but I am advocating for a more natural and organic approach to the project lifecycle.  This is what we have done for UMW Blogs, ds106, and now Domain of One's Own. And guess what, unlike all the corporate MOOCs we aren't simply recreating the LMS, we're designing a new way to build community around distributed nodes within a campus network both for face-to-face and online.  "Jim Groom,Will Shuttleworth Reclaim Your Domain?,http://bavatuesdays.com/will-shuttleworth-reclaim-your-domain/,11/1/2013,"Shuttleworth Foundation Application Video from Jim Groom on Vimeo.  I just completed and submitted my applciation for a Shutteworth Foundation Fellowship. I've been using the Flash Grant I recieved from Shuttleworth over the Summer to build Reclaim Hosting, fund ds106 development, and bring folks like Alan Levine, Audrey Watters, Kin Lane, and David Wiley to Fredericksburg so we could imagine what a project that enabled folks to take control over their online presence might look like. This proposal is in many ways a result of those conversations, projects, and more. I try and layout the idea for this fellowship as clearly as possible in the above video (which I am currently editing down to five minutes) as well buttres the vision in more detail in the application. Take the jump to view the application, and here's to hoping!  Essay questions: Please provide responses to the essay questions below. The responses to the questions should not exceed 2 typed pages in total. Please think about how your idea relates to technology, knowledge and learning and how your idea relates to openness when answering each section.  Describe the world as it is. (A description of the status quo and context in which you will be working)  The web remains the single most powerful space for connecting people and providing a global context to the way we live and learn, for the last twenty years it has defined a moment and spawned a culture heretofore unimaginable. That said, one of the greatest issues we face with the web ? and as time goes by it will only get greater ? is the difficulty for the average person to manage and control their online data. More often than not, our data is controlled by third party services that often feel no long-term obligation to provide us access to our digital life bits. In other words, we're headed for a crisis of online coherence wherein the images we took, the videos we made, the posts we wrote, the links we saved, etc. are not easily integrated, archived, and shared between and, more importantly, beyond any one social media service/silo.  What change do you want to make? (A description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area)  I want to create an open source API marketplace that enables the everyday web user to take control, duplicate, and archive their data online. An approach that does not advocate people abandoning third party social networking services that connect them with friends, family, and strangers (for in many ways that is the life's blood of the web), but rather provide a simple and powerful open source, web-based application (and ultimately service) for preserving their data and its context across a wide variety of social networking services in a space that they control.  What do you want to explore? (A description of the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year)  I want to explore how we can design and build an application that will allow the average web user to start reclaiming and controlling their data from various web services (such as Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.). In my mind this starts with exploring how both a syndication framework using open formats (such as really simple syndication, or RSS) alongside a robust service specific API marketplace that can provide aggregation-based personal hubs that enable the average user to control, manage, and preserve their data across a wide range of online services. What's more, such a framework has both immediate and long term implications for the preservation of an ocean of data that an entire generation of web users will want to preserve moving forward. For almost two decades of personal and cultural memories have been captured digitally; as a broader, global culture it is crucial that we work together to begin exploring how we both archive and make this memory accessible on both a personal and global scale moving forward. Reclaim your Domain is an open experiment that will both educate and setup best practices, as well as build an open source web-based tool to aggregate, share, and archive our online identities, essentially providing a way to personally future-proof our individual (and by extension cultural) legacies on the web. Such an approach to managing and controlling the digital fragments of our online life has a very definite business application for those who wish to pursue that side of things ? providing hosted solutions for personal digital archiving of our life on the web will be a huge, emerging market sometime very soon. And while the idea here is focused specifically on what we can do now to educate and provide a service for best practices and possibilities for harvesting, controlling, and preserving one's online data, I believe the world will be just a bit better if we can empower as many people as possible to take control over their own digital legacy.  What are you going to do to get there? (A description of what you actually plan to do during the year)  For the last nine years I have been wrestling with this question on my personal blog (http:/bavatuesdays.com) and as part of the work I do as both a professor and director of Teaching and Learning Technologies at the University of Mary Washington. If given the opportunity, I would spend the next year working on a project that a few of us (including Kin Lane and Audrey Watters) began imagining at a Hackathon at M.I.T. hosted by Philipp Schmidt and jointly sponsored by M.I.T. and U.C. Irvine's Digital Media Learning Labs. We called the project Reclaim Your Domain, and the idea was that we would develop an application (and eventually a service) that would help people reclaim their digital life by walking them through setting up their own domain name and webhosting account. As well as demonstrating how they can install the open source software we develop to both push and pull their work from the various services they belong to into a more centralized, name specific space online that they control. And while they wouldn't be getting rid of their various third party services (such as Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, etc.), they would be both synchronizing and archiving the work they do on those various spaces on their own web space seamlessly through syndication and site specific APIs. In fact, their domain becomes an aggregation point for their online identity that can then be archived for the long term.  Background information: Please provide responses to the background information questions and demographic data below. The responses to the questions should not exceed 2 typed pages in total. Some of the questions may not be applicable to your circumstances. If that is the case please indicate that.  Have you started implementation of the idea? If so, please provide details on organisational structure, life cycle and progress.  I started work on this idea with Kin Lane and Audrey Watters at an MIT Hackathon organized by Philipp Schmidt in April 2013. Over the Summer, thanks to a Shuttleworth Flash Grant, I worked with my partner Tim Owens to build out the hosting service Reclaim Hosting (http://reclaimhosting.com) that has enabled hundreds of faculty and students to take control of their digital identities. This model was based on the project we created at the University of Mary Washington (UMW), Domain of One's Own (http://umwdomains.com), that will give every student, staff, and faculty member their own domain and web hosting. This is a project that has caught on with universities like Duke, Stanford, Penn State, and the Virginia Community College System expressing serious interest, and Reclaim Hosting is a way to provide these universities with a scalable model for doing this at their campus. In 2010 I started ds106 (http://ds106.us), an online course that is designed around a syndication-rich model for building and scale online learning around individuals at the course level. What's more, all these individual setup and manage their own domain and web hosting and then aggregate it into a community/course hub. A portion of the Shuttleworth Flash Grant I received have been used to fund Alan Levine's development of an open source theme for WordPress that abstracts out the Assignment Bank concept (http://assignments.ds106.us) so that anyone can freely experiment with this popular feature of ds106. The Reclaim Your Domain part of all this becomes the open source software that faculty, students, and staff install and manage to understand this space as somewhere they can manage their distributed online presences to take back some control and provide a layer of coherence to the web without capitulating its defining principle of decentralization. I brought Kin Lane, Audrey Watters, Alan Levine, and David Wiley to Fredericksburg, Virginia in order to sit down and frame out this model more definitively in regards to the specific need for it, how it intersects with open educational communities, and what it will looks like as an actual open source application. At this point, Kin Lane, Audrey Watters, and Tim Owens are all prepared to work with me to make this vision a reality.   How have you funded your initiative in the past?  In addition to using a portion of the Flash Grant to build Reclaim Hosting, I continue to invest my own money and resources in that project. Additionally, I have funded development for the various features of ds106 and convened a group of thinkers to imagine the next steps of Reclaim Your Domain. Additionally, ds106 was awarded $2000 for winning the Innovation Contest from Reclaim Open Learning. The award is meant to honor projects that embody principles of open education and participatory learning which will be used to further abstract out elements of ds106 to enable this distributed/hub model for course to be easier and more readily available to anyone for free. Other than that, it's all been duct tape and ball bearings.  Who are your current or potential key partners?   Tim Owens (http://timmmmyboy.com), Kin Lane (http://apievangelist.com), Audrey Watters (http://hackeducation.com), David Wiley (http://opentcontent.org), Alan Levine (http://cogdogblog.com) and Philipp Schmidt (http://p2pu.org)  Do you intend to implement the idea as a for-profit or not-for-profit initiative in the future?  Reclaim your Domain will be a not-for-profit utility and framework for people to install on their server and utilize.  Where will you be based during a potential fellowship?

I literally stumbled into the field as a wayward literature Ph.D. candidate, and the ideas I discovered during the first days of personal blogging, namely creating, openly sharing, remixing, and archiving, continue to drive the work I am part of a decade later. For all that has changed, the ethos has stayed the same.  The Domain of One's Own presentation at TEDxUSagradoCorazon is actually four minutes shorter than the 18 minutes allotted, and I think I do a decent job of relating the Jon Udell's idea of trailing edge technologies to the power of the web as a space that is predicated on open formats, free-for-all sharing, and distributed empowerment that scales globally yet is grounded in the individual. I think I was able to get at most of these ideas somewhat cleanly, and besides the fact I am busting out of my suit these days (too many barbacoa burritos at Chipotle! ?? ) I think this is a solid attempt ? within a long line of attempts ? to try and both explain and conceptualze Domain of One's Own more broadly.  "Jim Groom,DTLT Today Episode 107: Marie McAllister's Domain of Her Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/dtlt-today-episode-107-marie-mcallisters-domain-of-her-own/,11/20/2013,"For the 107th episode of DTLT Today, I sat down with English professor Marie McAllister to talk about her ongoing experimentation with technologies in her teaching over the last decade more generally. In particular, the amazing work she has done with the ever growing poetry anthology site Eighteenth Century Audio ? a perennial UMW Blogs site that is one-of-a-kind on the web. Marie was part of the Domain of one's Own faculty initiative this past Spring, and what I love about her approach is that she is not afraid to experiment. Over the course of this discussion we talk about her work with an honor's Medical Writing course on DocuWiki, the English Coffee House Bulletin Board built within phpBB, her various forays intoWordPress, and her long history with MediaWiki. This is truly a domain of her own, and she epitomizes the vision of faculty becoming sysadmins of their profesional spaces online.  What's more, I obviously agree with her when she says every university should be experimenting in this space right now ? but this kind of reaction amongst our most discerning faculty is really encouraging. I can't thank Marie enough for sitting down with me, and it's remarkable just how articulate she is about the future of Domain of One's Own ? I thought that was my job! ?? There's nothing better than listening to UMW faculty imagine this space, and we have only just begun.  "Jim Groom,"Open, Public Educational Publishing Platforms #4life",http://bavatuesdays.com/open-public-educational-publishing-platforms-4life/,11/27/2013,"On Monday I checked in on the traffic stats for UMW Blogs, something I do from time-to-time when the semester starts to slow (the fact this didn't happen until week 14 is telling). I was pleasantly surprised to see that UMW Blogs hit a new high for visits in a single day with 14,099 on Thursday, November 14. This is about 5,000 more visits than our daily average of 9,000. So, alongside Tim Owens and Martha Burtis, I started to dig into the details of the traffic for November 14th to see if there was any one post that was driving up the traffic. And, lo and behold, this post about The Matrix and the allegory of the cave by a student named Rebecca in Zach Whalenïs Spring 2012 Adaptation course got 715 up votes on Reddit, and the rest is UMW Blogs traffic history.  In just one day that post got 4,356 hits, and 8,193 hits over the course of the month. Crazy.  This list of traffic by landing pages not only illustrates the reddit effect for the Matrix post, but also pointed us to another post that has been getting a lot of traffic this month. The post in question provides context for the pioneering research of scientists Masters and Johnson into human sexual response. This post was part of the Psychological History of Women resource site professor Dennis Nissam-Sabat's students created back in the Fall of 2011. Turns out this post is getting so much traffic because it actually is a top-ten Google search result for the term ""Masters and Johnson."" Which, as it turns out, is quite timely given the relationship between Masters and Johnson is currently the basis for a successful Showtime series titled Masters of Sex.  Masters of Sex  How about that, people interested in using the web to find out more about a particular topic cable televison has piqued their interest in. And what comes up in their Google search? A resource site created by students as part of a class at a public university that is paying it forward with open publishing platforms. This shouldn't be radical, this should be the norm. And this, I would argue, is what gets lost when we suggests that all cats are gray and the LMS is just a misunderstood tool. Fact is, the LMS does not understand itself as part of the web, it has been purposefully designed to be anathema to it. Take a look at that screenshot above, what else is getting traffic? These aren't throwaway topics, these are important ideas people want help understanding. For example, what W.E.B. DuBois's concept of double consiousness means, or some more information on the social control theory of organized crime (might use that for the True Crime course), or some more context to more fully understand Arthur Penn's film Bonnie & Clyde.  All this makes me very happy, and also makes me feel like I'm doing my job as an instructional technologist. I shouldn't be slavishly supporting enterprise systems that firewall information, I should be building communities that are premised upon openly sharing the work we're doing as public institutions. I understand the need for the LMS, I just don't understand its value. This field should be pushing to make the work faculty and students are doing part and parcel of the web in order to bridge the understanding for hundreds of thousands of people on the web. And this is not overstatement, this is an everyday reality at Mary Washington thanks to an open, public educational publishing platform like UMW Blogs, and more recently Domain of One's Own. These aren't just fringe experiments, or at least they shouldn't be. They should represent the moral imperative of what we do as part of the teaching and learning mission at the core of our institutions' raison d'tre. The question we should be asking is how that mission has increasingly become compromised by the dominant technologies we still find ourselves entrenched within at our institutions.  "Jim Groom,Course Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/course-domains/,11/30/2013,"You can blame Brian Lamb for this post, he encouraged me to go for the trifecta. My last two posts were about 1) the possibilities public university publishing platforms offer institutions of higher ed to align their mission with the web, and 2) (if you can look beyond the nudie bombs and GIFs long enough ?? ) how communities like Tumblr can be amazing open educational resources. So, for the third and final installment of this unplanned and rather haphazard series, I want to talk about an emerging trend at UMW that has me pretty excited: course domains.  Although, to be honest, this post has in many ways already been written by Ryan Brazell. In ""Mapping the Taiping Civil War"" he lays out the amazing work he is doing alongside History professor Sue Fernsebner (speaking of educational Tumblrs!) and her students for the re-imagined research methods course she's teaching this semester focusing on the Taiping Rebellion. In short, they have gotten a domain for the course (http://taipingcivilwar.org), and as a class are working together to build a really impressive series of resources on the Taiping Civil War. They're building a dynamic map of the civil war, a timeline, and a student-conducted interview with Chinese scholar Dr. Tobie Meyer-Fong about her recent book on the topic ""What Remains: Coming to Terms with Civil War in 19th Century China.""  Think about it, fifteen newly decalred history majors drilling into a focused topic alongside a faculty member who's guiding them in the collaborative construction of an intellectual resource designed specifcially for the web. As a part of this process they're learning about the power of mapping for reading the past, the importance of annotated chronological resources, and how to interview top scholars in the field on their latest research. What's more, it's happening on the open web. And all because a professor simply said, ""Why not?"" Why can't UMW undergrads do this? Why can't we work together to build a resource for a broader public rather than remain a slave to the individually produced research papers that two people will ever read? Why can't a course have a domain that becomes the ongoing record of the thinking about a topic that anyone can access? It reminds me a lot of the amazing work Jon Beasely- Murray has been with his students on Wikipedia since 2009.  I have to believe the work we've been doing with UMW Blogs since 2007 has made the move towards independent course domains a realtively seamless progression. Faculty like Sue Fernsebner have used UMW Blogs extensively over the last six years, and their comfort level with this space affords them an intimate understanding of it's possibilities and limitations. And while not all courses need their own domain, a course that wants to experiment with various open source applications besides WordPress (i.e. Omeka, MediaWIki, DOCuWiki, Drupal, etc.), and at the same time become an established, onging academic resource for a broader community, a course domain is a powerful option. This is why UMW Domains (a.k.a. Domain of One's Own) represents a really exciting new frontier for us at DTLT that we are now in a postion to not only offer any faculty memebr, but also fully support them on their journey. That's instructional technology, that's developing faculty, that's give students relevant web-absed literacies, and that's building a better, more open web all the while. With Domain of One's Owen we continue to make good on our university's mission. But let me end returning to Ryan Brazell's post on the Taiping Civil War project, because he nails how cool this is far better than I ever could:  > All of the resources created by the students are now and will remain available to the general public via TaipingCivilWar.org, the project website. We still have some work to do to clean up what's there and to include additional resources created by the students, but you can already see the time and effort students put in to make this happen. Word has it that a major peer- reviewed journal in the field has even expressed interest in linking to the project website once it's ready for prime-time  ?  how cool is that?  That's not only super cool, but that's educational!  "Jim Groom,Shuttleworth Flash Update,http://bavatuesdays.com/shuttleworth-flash-grant-update/,11/30/2013,"This Summer I got a Shuttleworth Foundation flash grant thanks to David Wileyïs recommendation. I've blogged about what I've done as part of the grant over the last several months, but I wanted to summarize it all here.  Reclaim Hosting   Domain of One's Own is a service we're running at the University of Mary Washington that provides members of the academic community their own domain name and web hosting account. The idea at the heart of this initiative is to give faculty, staff, and students the tools to start interrogating the web more robustly. A space to enpower the community to understand how the web works, become sysadmins of their education, and more completely control what they do as part of their portfolio at the university. As we were running the Domain of One's Own pilot at UMW during the 2012/2013 academic year a number of universities inquired how exaclty we were architecting this experiment, and how might they go about the process.  Thanks to this flash grant, Tim Owens and I were able to create Reclaim Hosting, a parallel service to Domain of One' Own that enables any faculty, student, course, department, or institution get up and running with a education-focused hosting. We've kept the web hosting cost at next to nothing, and simply charge $12 for a domain thanks to funding from the flash grant, which has enabled us to focus on building a community and providing a space for faculty and staff to start imagining the possibilities of maintaining and controlling their own home on the web. Over the last three months more than 700 faculty and students have signed up from numerous K12 and higher education instituions around the world. Additionally, we've had interest in institution- wide pilots from the Virginia Community College System, Emory University, Duke University, and Penn State University.  Minding the Future/Reclaim Your Domain Brainstorming  Image credit"" Alan Levine's ""Audrey Watters takes on the world""  In October I organized a conference called ""Minding the Future,"" an event that was c0-sponsored by the University of Mary Washington, the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia (SCHEV), and the Shuttleworth Foundation (thanks to the flash grant). We were able to bring together five remarkable thinkers in the higher education space to deliver 10 minute talks about their particular field of interest as well as take part in a culminating panel discussion about the future of higher education more generally. It was a remarkable program and event, if I must say so myself, but you can be the judge of that yourself because all of the sessions were recorded and are freely available for viewing on the UMW New Media YouTube channel. What's more, Sarah McConnell from the NPR radio show ""With Good Reason"" attended the conference and included segments from the panel discussion in her recent piece on ""The Future of Higher Education"" that aired earlier this month (you can listen below).  Part of the excuse of bringing all of these folks together was to put them in a room and start honing the vision for an idea I started working on with Kin Lane and Audrey Watters back in April called Reclaim Your Domain. We not only got a great conference out of this gathering, but also some real insights to what's possible and what's next with the Reclaim Your Domain project, which I wrote about in great detail already. Suffice to say Reclaim Your Domain would become an open source application that provides anyone with a hosting account the ability to have access to an API marketplace for backing and synching your work with third party services, translating between services, and providing a contextual series of resources for understaning of these services work and why it's important to understand this.  ds106: Assignment Nuevo Bank  Finally, the development of the ds106 assignment bank as a stand alone theme that is open source and freely downloadable by anyone using WordPress is the final element funded by the flash grant. Alan Levine has been working on developing this theme, and the work he has done so far is amazing. He took me on a walk-through of the theme, and what's remarkable to me is that it captures the essence of open educational design as it pertains to communities rather than the more generalized obsession with content.  I think any discussion of Reclaim Hosting, Domain of One's Own, and/or Reclaim Your Domain both germinted and hatched for me during the experiment that is the open, online digital storytelling course known as ds106. And I would argue that no one has done more for that community to date than Alan Levine. His work really epitomizes the spirit of the Reclaim ethos in practice (despite the problems with the term reclaim more specifically). It's not about shunning third party social media on the web, it's about developing a more sophisticated understanding of how it all works. It's about wrestling with the idea of online identity, and as result shaping a sense of self that is truly digital in its expression. Alan Levine has come to be a mentor for me, and many others as well, in all these things for many years now. He lives and breathes the web, he's more web than human ? but contains mutlitudes of both ??  So, that's where the flash grant funds have gone and will go. I say this fully acknowledging that I have applied for a Shuttleworth fellowship with the Reclaim Your Domain project, and really hope to have the opportunity to focus all my time and energy on working with people like Tim Owens, Kin lane, Audrey Watters, Jon Udell, David Wiley, and, of course, Alan Levine. Alan's Shuttleworth project proposal is near and dear to the vision of Reclaim Your Domain, and if this Fellowship happens we're all gonna have a lot to work on. I'm going right after a project, getting some funding, and building somthing that can not only archive, synch, and convert one's various presences online, but ultimately start to bring them together in a distributed social network like the one Martha Burtis and Tim Owens have begun to do with the directory for Domain of One's Own.  The prospect of taking some time away and working on this as a Shuttleworth fellow is really exciting. I had an interview almost two weeks ago and I have to admit I'm not so sure how it went. I talked a lot, and I was a bit circular in my explanations so I can understand if they're a bit leary. That said, the flash grant has started the ball rolling, and I'm really excited about where it might go. I'd like to think Shuttleworth will take that chance, but if not I think someone will. Why not, the domain of archiving and taking back control over the various data we have left in the hands of third party services will only grow as time goes on, more services shut down, and the web is recognized as the native medium wherein our memories are being created. Here's to hoping, and if I don't mention I got the fellowship on this blog anytime soon, you'll know what happened ??  "Jim Groom,ds106 Interview for Reclaim Open Learning,http://bavatuesdays.com/ds106-interview-for-reclaim-open-learning/,12/6/2013,"A couple of months ago Alan Levine, Martha Burtis, and I sat down with Anya Kamanetz to be be interviewed about ds106 for the Reclaim Open Learning initiative. I just realized this had been published on the Recalim open Learning site , and it's a good snapshot of how the three of us are thinking about ds106 at the moment. Martha captures the larger spirit of what ds106 has come to mean for us at UMW, it's part of a longer history of experimenting with what teaching and learning means for narrating and shaping one's online presence in an increasingly networked world.  > I think it's fair to say that a lot of this grew out of experiences that we have been having at UMW dating back to 2004 where everyone in the division had gotten their own domain name and web hosting space, and it had changed the landscape of our work. This space became a place for narrating our own experiences and the process of learning. That grew into the notion that students could use the space to do that more broadly and more richly.  "Jim Groom,De-Icing the MOOC Research Conference,http://bavatuesdays.com/de-icing-the-mooc-research-conference/,12/7/2013,"Image credit: Michael Branson Smith's awesome ""Day of the Mooc""  I am currently sitting in Dallas Fort Worth airport hoping to escape the ice storm that hit Dallas during the MOOC Research confernece. Despite the atypical elements, this is one of the best conferneces I've been to in a while, right up there with OpenEd (kudos to George Siemens, Amy Collier, and Tanya Joosten for a job well done). The quality of people was amazing and the vibe, as Mike Caulfield already mentioned, was almost dreamlike. I also had the distinct pleasure of finally meeting a number of awesome folks who I've been following on the internet for a long while now, in particular Bon Stewart, Martin Weller and Martin Hawksey.  I also met a whole bunch of new folks, and attended a wide range of sessions in hopes of moving beyond some of the MOOC-hype (which I think this conference did quite well) and look at what we're really starting to learn from this phenomenon. And while I'm not convinced that large, corporate MOOCs are educating the world and feeding the children, I do have a better sense just how variegated coporate MOOCs can be in their approach thanks to Weller's research. It was also apparent just how much this moment has served to reinforce the fact that online learning has arrived in the hearts and minds of administrators everywhere.  It still befuddles me just how quickly big brand, research 1 universities have been to give away the farm to third-party, for-profit platforms. Especially as the MOOC hype has been somewhat tempered by Saint Sebastian's recent pivot (which I think was very good for the tenor of the conference more generally). At the same time Bon Stewart's admonitions for some kind of organized response to start filling the temporary void of direction with alternative narrative still rings in my ears ? and it is very much the lesson I took away from Audrey Watters keynote at OpenEd.  Finally, it was cool to see the O.G. triumvirate George Siemens, Stephen Downes, and Dave Cormier representing their frankenstein-like brainchild ?? I have to take a moment to hand it to all three of them, they've weathered a pretty intense hi-jacking of their ideas from back in 2008 with a tremendous amount of class (lesser folks, like me, would have crumbled). What's more, they're stewarding the conversation in ways I think do the entire field a great service. What's more, Stephen Downes was really happy. I mean really happy! I guess that's a result of him getting the well-deserved and long overdue credit and resources to really start making his orginal vision of the technological aggregation of these disparate networks a reality. Congratualtions!  As for me, well, I slayed them!   More seriously, for my last few talks (since my University of North Florida presentation in September) I've been trying to narrate the progression of the work I've been part of more broadly at UMW. In particular, I focus on the development of projects in UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technology from the BlueHost Experiment to UMW Blogs to ds106 to Domain of One's Own and beyond. The narrative is a compelling one, and it is an honor to represent the work we're doing at UMW to folks from around the world. It's also cool to situate ds106 as a creative alternative within the MOOC discourse. At the same time, I'm becoming more comfortable with my role at UMW as an ambassador for the work DTLT, our faculty, and students are doing. It always feels a bit awkward, but at the same time people are beginning to recognize and understand UMW as a hub for the ""Digital Liberal Arts"" in part because of these presentations ? and that's not necessarily bad thing. Any, below is the abstract for the talk as well as the slides for the presentation. If and when there is a video I will share it here as well. [Update: there is a video recording and here's the link.] Now if I could only make it home.  > This presentation will examine a decade worth of experimentation and development at the University of Mary Washington that has resulted in a series of innovative projects such as UMW Blogs, ds106, and Domain of One's Own ? not to mention its recent spin-off Reclaim Hosting. What all these projects have in common is they operate from a shared ethos of supporting an open environment for teaching and learning online by helping faculty and students alike exert control over the digital spaces they learn, teach, and ultimately live in.  "Jim Groom,"Andreà Livi Smith Teaches, Learns, and Lives By Design",http://bavatuesdays.com/andrea-livi-smith-teaches-learns-and-lives-by-design/,12/12/2013,"DTLT Today: Episode 109 ? Andreà Livi Smith from Jim Groom on Vimeo.  It's finals week and everyone is slammed for time right now on campus, but Historic Preservation professor Andreà Livi Smith was still generous enough to sit with me for a half hour and talk about the work she's done as part of the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative and beyond. Andi is a remarkable faculty member, and she is behind some of the most exciting work happening at UMW right now. She not only blogs like it's her job at Digital Bridging, but she's also designed a brilliant homepage for her courses, research, and social media presences, something we explore at length in this video.  We also talk about the work she has done with Martha Burtis designing a database on UMW Blogs called Surveying the Burg. This site enables students to survey houses from around Fredericksburg on smart phones from the field. It's remarkable in that it starts to demonstrate just how much more than a blog this open source, relatively simple software can be ? namely, a fullblown research resource that undergraduates help build and populate.  We finished up the conversation talking about Plunked! ? a board game Andi and her students designed that teaches you about the principles of preservation planning. The work they've done is pretty remarkable, and it gets at a broader theme Andi touched on throughout the discussion. The importance of design in the work she does not only around urban planning, but also the crucial role it plays in her teaching, computing, and her life more generally. For Andi, the design of spaces both online and off frame one's relationship with others in so many different contexts beyond the purely professional, and the way in which she truly lives her identity ebulliently across all of those domains makes her so compelling as a professor, researcher, and colleague, but more than all of those, as a person. She's an inspiration!  About the Series  This is the fourth episode in an ongoing series focusing specifically on the amazing work faculty at UMW are doing with teaching, learning, and research as it intersects with technology. You can see my previous discussions with UMW's humanities librarian Jack Bales on his Chicago Cubs research, as well as a conversation with English professor Marie McAllister (episode 107) about mastering ehr own domain. I'm still editing a fascianting back-and-forth I had with Political Science Steve Farnsworth (episode 108) about building his online presence through Domain of Ones Own ? that will be published shortly.  "none,"Mellon Foundation Awards Davidson $800,000 to Expand Digital Studies",https://www.davidson.edu/news/news-stories/131213-mellon-foundation-digital-studies-award,12/13/2013,"December 13, 2013  At a recent showcase of projects by students in digital studies classes, Yasmin Shahida '14 explains her project to Professor of English Suzanne Churchill, who taught a class in ""Picturing Texts, Making Media.""  Davidson College has received an $800,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to create a curricular model of digital studies that can be replicated by other small liberal arts colleges. The grant will support the development and expansion of digital studies throughout the college's curriculum, particularly in the humanities, during the years 2014 to 2017.  The initiative follows a year of researching best practices in the use of digital media and technologies for teaching and curricular development, which also was funded by the Mellon Foundation.  Davidson's program will reach a broad base of students and stresses collaboration among faculty, library and information technology staff, and students. It also seeks to create lasting connections between Davidson and the research-oriented universities in our region.  ""Members of the Davidson College community have been experimenting with technology in the curriculum for a long time,"" explained Associate Dean for Curriculum Pat Sellers, who helped coordinate the research and writing of the grant proposal. ""This grant builds on the preexisting interests of faculty, staff, and students, making it easier for them to develop their interests and expertise.""  The grant focuses on four areas: (1) new faculty and staff positions; (2) student, faculty, and staff development; (3) curriculum design; and (4) a ""digital collaboratory."" Director of Digital Studies Mark Sample will lead the overall program.  ### New Faculty and Staff Positions  Katie Wilkes '14 presents a project for ""Picturing Texts, Making Media"" that involves digitizing rare books.  The grant will allow Davidson to hire new tenure-track professors in positions that are jointly shared between a Humanities department and Digital Studies. The grant calls for adding one tenure-track position in 2015-2016 and a second one in 2016-2017. Beginning in 2017-2018, Davidson will assume all costs associated with these positions.  ""I'm very excited to bring in young scholars working on the vanguard of digital culture and tools,"" said Sample. ""These new professors will help introduce new ways of thinking about the traditional humanities and the liberal arts from digital perspectives.""  Davidson also will hire a two-year post-doctoral fellow to work within Digital Studies, starting next fall. The post-doctoral fellow will teach classes in his or her specialty and also mentor faculty and students in their own digital research. Davidson's library and information technology professionals will reevaluate skill sets and overall staffing in light of curriculum development, and increase permanent and fixed-term positions as necessary.  ### Student, Faculty, and Staff Development  The grant will promote several ways to develop student, faculty and staff expertise with key digital tools and platforms.  Among these initiatives is ""Davidson Domains,"" which will provide every Davidson student a unique domain name and access to an open-source platform like WordPress. The Web domain will serve as a foundation for students' online presence at Davidson and beyond. As students progress through the Davidson curriculum, they will learn how to add content to the domain from any aspect of their experience. Students might use it to display outstanding assignments, samples of internship work or research experience, and more.  Ideally, students will be able to keep the domain and content after leaving Davidson. The program will begin next year as a pilot using several sections of the required first-year writing course, with first-year students in 2015-2016 as the first full participants.  ""Students' domains will function as concrete products of their work that are much more detailed than r?sum?s,"" explained Sellers. ""Domains will make it easier for Davidson students to show their collegiate achievements to potential employers.""  Other elements of the grant aimed at developing student, faculty, and staff familiarity and fluency with digital tools include:     Faculty and staff development programs. The grant will support faculty and staff involvement in the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching Institute, regional THATCamps and other workshops and seminars.    Digital Learning Communities. Groups of faculty and staff will meet semi-weekly to explore a particular tool or methodological approach, such as Big Data or GIS, and develop a curricular use for it.    Digital Studies Interdisciplinary Minor. The grant also will help the college to develop an interdisciplinary minor in digital studies. This minor will support students in any major as they critically approach digital culture, digital tools and digital methodologies.    Digital Innovation Micro-grants. Individuals or teams of faculty, staff and students may apply for microgrants for entrepreneurial digital projects that advance the liberal arts mission of the college. Possible projects might include apps, plugins, websites, podcasts and other digital tools.    Digital Course Development Grants. The grants will provide funds to support faculty and staff who want to ""digitalize"" an existing course or to develop an entirely new digital project that furthers the college's liberal arts mission.    Digital Collaboratory. Faculty, staff and students will come together to discuss innovations linking technology and curriculum. The ""Digital Collaboratory"" will fund guest speakers on the subject, digital projects and an annual showcase of curricular innovations using technology.    Cross-Institutional Student Writing. As part of the required first-year writing course, students will gain experience in writing for larger publics by sharing their work with students at other institutions. The shared writing and corresponding comments on writing samples will improve students' writing skills and prepare them to write for broader, more diverse and more public audiences.  ### Commitment to Digital Success  Brian McRae '14 and Associate Professor Mark Sample, director of Davidson's digital studies program.  Davidson has made or is making commitments in several areas to ensure the success of the Digital Studies Program. They include the appointment of Mark Sample as Visiting Associate Professor of Digital Studies, the redefinition of information technology and library positions, including the addition of a specialist in digital preservation and curation, and hiring new staff to support the Digital Studies Program.  Additionally, information technology has recently converted a Chambers Building room into a pilot makerspace, named ""Studio M,"" which features a 3D printer, material for physical computing and robotic toolkits.  Sellers explained what makes Davidson's approach to digital studies unique. ""Other institutions have focused on developing digital tools and databases for professors' and students' individual research projects,"" he said. ""We've taken a different approach by trying to spread digital studies as widely through the curriculum as possible.""  Sample expressed his support for the college's commitment to promoting curricular digital integration. ""Media theorist Douglas Rushkoff made a valid point with the title of his book Program or be Programmed,"" he said. ""If we don't critically use and think about technology, then we will be used by technology.""  Sample concluded, ""It's almost impossible to be a responsible, informed citizen of the world without knowing, using, and having a critical stance toward technology and the digital world. Cultivating that critical stance fits in with Davidson College's liberal arts mission, and we're thrilled this Mellon grant will advance that mission.""  "Jim Groom,Davidson Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/davidson-domains/,12/13/2013,"Davidson College just announced they were awarded a Mellon Grant ""to create a curricular model of digital studies that can be replicated by other small liberal arts colleges."" Pat Sellers coordinated the grant and Mark Sample will be the lead for developing the curricular model. I was particualrly excited that one of the centerpieces of the grant will include ""Davidson Domains"" which in many ways reinforces some of the work we're doing with Domain of One's Own:  > Among these initiatives is ""Davidson Domains,"" which will provide every Davidson student a unique domain name and access to an open source platform like WordPress. The Web domain will serve as a foundation students' online presence at Davidson and beyond. As students progress through the Davidson curriculum, they will learn how to add content to the domain from any aspect of their experience. Students might use it to display outstanding assignments, samples of internship work or research experience, and more.  This is awesome for Davidson, it's also awesome for UMW Domains and Reclaim Hosting to help reinforce the value of some of the work we've been doing along these lines. External validation works wonders in-house, as I'm sure many of you know. It also helps establish that both the technical and curricular integration of something like Domain of One's Own are not nearly as crazy as they might have seemed just a year ago. I want to believe we're beginning to witness a subtle, yet profound, shift in thinking about how institutions can invest in a future of educational technology that is premised around networks that enable everyone on campus to help imagine what's possible from their own online platforms. The secret sauce is working through how we can divine a sense of coherence as a campus community through syndication, aggregation, and generative juxtaposition. I really think that the fact that Davidson Domains has framing their digital studies curriculum in this way further buoys my sense that this approach defintiely has legs.  It also reaffirms what Mike Caulfield noted on Twitter a while back ??  > Boss just asked me why she'd never heard of UMW and #ds106 if it was so influential. Told her UMW was like the Velvet Underground of edtech.  >  ?  Mike Caulfield (@holden) October 4, 2013  "Jim Groom,UMW Domains a Win for Open,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-a-win-for-open/,12/23/2013,"Audrey Watters has been on an all-out tear over at Hack Education as she wraps up the year in edtech. Few, if any, in the field are sharper, more concise, and resolutely independent of the institutional and corporate entanglements that pervade this space. I'll echo so many others who have recognized how unbelievably important her voice is as a result. That said, working independently, speaking freely, and calling out so many on their nonsense doesn't always pay the rent, so to help ameliorate this UMW's DTLT would like to provide a standing offer of a job for Audrey when she finally decides to settle down ??  Until then, I totally support her writing things like what follows when ennumerating the many ""wins for open"" in her recent post ""Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2013: The Battle for ïOpen':""  > University of Mary Washington's ""Domain of One's Own"" initiative (one of the very best things in ed-tech right now) has been picked up by other universities, including Emory and Davidson. Also, in addition to the Domain of One's Own project, we saw efforts to ""Reclaim Your Domain"" and to Reclaim Hosting.  I know I'm biased, but I have to agree with Audrey 100% that Domain of One's Own and its Reclaim tributaries are amongst the best things happening in edtech right now. And while I may have let myself get overly excited at the prospect of building on these initiatives independently over the next year as a Shuttleworth fellow, especially since I recently found out that won't be happening, it doesn't dull my enthusiasm in the least. Shuttleworth would have provided some nice start-up funds and a certain amount of geographical freedom for my family and I, but in the end that's all it would have provided. The idea is still there, the people interested are still awesome, and the rejection by Shuttleworth just makes me that much more determined to make it all work.  I've had some time over the last week to consider what my plan will be for the coming year, and I'm doubling down on what we're doing at UMW with Domain of One's Own. We already have the infrastructure, the institutional support, and an amazing community of faculty, staff, and students. I've let myself get pulled in way too many directions this last semester between the idea of becoming a Shuttleworth fellow, entertaining job offers, and negotiating structural shifts at UMW. That's my fault, and I take full blame for the fractured attention to my work. But hope springs eternal, and it's high time I put all of the distractions aside and start focusing all my energy on Domain of One's Own. It's what I want to do anyway, and I'm realizing I don't need a fellowship or new surroundings for it to seem fresh. My work at UMW is not yet done, it's time to recognize that and get locked in again!  But first I have to enjoy the next three weeks in Italy.  "Jim Groom,TIny Tiny RSS,http://bavatuesdays.com/tiny-tiny-rss/,1/5/2014,"It's taken me more than six months to resurrect my RSS reader (pathetic, I know), but I've finally imported my forlorn collection of feeds into the open source application Tiny Tiny RSS. I went with this application based on a recommendation from Joss Winn a while back. It also made sense given UMW has rolled out Domain of One's Own this year ? an initiative that offers the entire campus community their own domain, hosting, and one-click installations from a vast selection of open source applications ? amongst which is Tiny Tiny RSS. A little bit of practicing what we preach is always good. More than anything, however, my six month hiatus from reading the web via RSS has reminded me just how invaluable it is to the work I do. A fact that has actually re-inspired my evangelical impulse to push faculty, students, and staff to get on the RSS bus. I mean, how can I resist it's value when one of the first posts that showed up in my reader was this Rankin Bass animated mashup of John Carpenter's The Thing (care of Bryan Alexander's ever inglorious Infocult).  It just feels like I am on the web again.  A few things about Tiny Tiny RSS. It has a pretty solid collection of plugins with a small, but fairly active, development community. Some of the plugins are packaged with the application, but there are also a fair number that aren't. The Google Reader Importer plugin is included, you just have to activate it. Given I was moving my archive from Google Reader, this was the first plugin I used. I also had a couple of hundred posts starred in Google Reader that didn't come over with the import, so I used this hack to the Google Reader importer plugin to preserve the favorited posts as well.  One of the things I noticed right away was that videos don't embed in Tiny Tiny RSS out-of-the-box. The Videoframes plugin fixes this by enabling embedded videos from a wide range of sites (YouTube, Daily Motion, Vimeo, etc.), but you have to add it via FTP. This one should be baked in.  Also, there are a wide range of plugins for sharing posts in your reader out to Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, etc. The plugin for Twitter worked fine, but the plugin for sharing on Tumblr is throwing an error with the latest version, so I might have to jump on the forum.  But that's kinda what I like about Tiny Tiny RSS, it reminds me a bit of the early days of hacking around WordPress. I have to work a bit to customize it for my needs ? that said it's very mature application as is ? which helps me understand how it works. I can start trying to trouble shoot some plguins, and even become part of a community around the application to figure it out. I don't need to be a programmer, I just need to articulate the issue and be patient and willing. What's more, I can bring what I learn back to the UMW community and beyond.  I initially installed Tiny Tiny RSS in the rss.murderinc.biz to give it a test drive. I originally wanted to install it at rss.jimgroom.com, but I didn't realize I hadn't set jimgroom.com as an add-on domain at UMW Domains yet. So, when Tim Owens informed me I could add jimgroom.com as an add-on domain to UMW Domains, I wanted to move everything I setup at rss.murderinc.biz to rss.jimgroom.com. Thanks to Installatron, the one-click application installer we have running on both UMW Domains and Reclaim Hosting, it was a cinch. You click on the Clone button for the particular application you installed, and point rss.murderinc.biz to the new subdomain rss.jimgroom.net and alle ist gut! Making sure things are relatively simple as you try and bring an entire campus up to speed on installing and managing their own applciations on their own domain (and subdomains) is absolutely crucial.  And what's available for the UMW community through UMW Domains is also available to anyone who is interested in this experiment outside of UMW at Reclaim Hosting. It's just another venue through which we can spread the love of what's possible in one's own space. Along these lines, I was excited to discover (through Brian Lamb's most recent post) that there's a broader sense the web's not dead yet. And there are a list of excellent reasons why staking your own space on the web that you build, maintain, and future-proof independent of third-party sites (though not necessarily at the exlusion of them) might make good sense. I was never under the delusion that a certain group in edtech was alone in this push, but I admittedly live in my own bubble (if and when I am hooked into my feed reader ?? ) ? so it's nice to read a broader frame for such an approach.

My purported role in this project is to be one of many ambassadors to the UMW students, extolling the virtues of the domain project and encouraging them to sign on.  I certainly AM on board with this idea. If you'd seen some of the social media presence exhibited by today's students, you would be too! Having a domain, like having a LinkedIn page should, in theory, be a way for the student to put forth their best foot. Impress employers/grad schools/future in-laws and the like with their academic and professional presence.

I am excited to learn more about managing my domain, to posting more frequently, to mixing in <del>some </del>a little serious information along with more amusing musings. I plan to look online and find some of the outstanding domains that I know UMW students and faculty/staff are developing (I've already found several!). I appreciate all the time Martha gave me today, and even more the fact that she turned down the chocolates I offered her as thanks for her assistanceƒall the more for me to eat, you know!  In conclusion let me wrap up with: Chocolates consumed (Kisses and leftover Christmas loot)?six (so far).

"Jim Groom,Reading Capital: a Long Overdue Postmortem,http://bavatuesdays.com/reading-capital-a-long-overdue-postmortem/,1/8/2014,"I spent part of the early Summer of 2008 exploring the possibilities of building an ad-hoc community around a series of videos of the Marxist scholar David Harvey teaching Karl Marx's Das Kapital Volume 1. A few folks at CUNY's Graduate Center got together and recorded Harvey's lectures and built a WordPress site around them. It was down and dirty, and the site is still around with all of the videos as well as a series of videos of him teaching the follow-up course, Das Kapital Volume 2. The site also acts as a blog that chronicles Harvey's ongoing chroncile lectures, interviews, and publications.  The Reading Capital community hub experiment I worked on in relationship to these videos was born out of a brief back-and-forth with the Grad Center's Chris Caruso, who was behind the site and videos. I started writing about the idea in this post, which chronciles my relationship to the Grad Center, a discussion with Chris, and the basic idea behind the site:  > One of the things I immediately thought of when I saw the site was how can it trace the discussions of the lectures that will take place over time in a distributed manner throughout the internets. If I want to refer back to the original blog with my ideas and reactions to a particular lecture, how can that site capture these discussion? A forum? Opening up comments? Allowing trackbacks and pings? I think allowing comments and trackbacks would be one way to suggests who is reading along and interacting with the lectures, I also thought something like Simple Forums might provide a way for folks to interact around the lectures who may not want to blog it regularly, or set up a separate space. In fact, tracing the discussion around these open resources is in many ways as important as the impetus to share them, and I'll be thinking about this over the coming months as I endeavor on this project.  This idea of ""tracing the discussion around these open resources"" as being as important as ""the impetus to share them"" has remained a consistent thread in the work we've done at DTLT with projects such as UMW Blogs, ds106, and now Domain of One's Own (and by extension Reclaim Hosting). In retrospect, the timing of the Reading Capital community hub is pretty interesting. I started working on Reading Capital when UMW Blogs was already fairly mature. By June, 2008 UMW Blogs was getting significant uptake, we were well into experimenting with syndication, and the site already had a solid community.  Marx and Engels lego photo used courtesy of Dunechaser  Reading Capital allowed me to see if such an experiment as UMW Blogs might work for a particular course (not unlike what we did with ds106 two years later). I wrote extensively about the plan for the site setup here, which Mike Caulfield commented intelligently upon even back then ? he's old reliable. In the following post about creating the site, I broke down how I was using a WordPress Multi-User install (that's before Multi-Site came on the scene) to allow a then imagined community to either get a blog at readingcapital.org, or add a link to their own blog so that it would syndicate posts from any site with a working feed using BDP RSS into FeedWordPress (that's O.G.EDUGLU a là Andre Malan, right there). In fact, at its height there were anywhere between 25 and 30 blogs aggregating into the site.  World Forum 1 image courtesy of Dunechaser.  The final post in the series focused on experimenting with bbPress forums and the Prologue theme to duplicate the functionality of Twitter. Something I hadn't figured out back then was rather than trying to duplicate the functionality of Twitter within the Reading Capital site, it would have made a lot more sense to just to create a good hashtag and do it on Twitter. As for the forums, they never really took off. I had expected as much, but this was the basis of further experiments with integrating BuddyPress, bbPress, and WPMu six months later. In fact, that post may have been the height of my WordPress psuedo-hacking era, my blogging in 2009 starts to move increasingly towards movies, toys, and ultimately ds106 over the next year ? all worthy pursuits.  But between Reading Capital and ds106 was another experiment that this recent post by Mike Caulfield reminded me of, namely Looking for Whitman. This was a site that used all of these features and more, such as BuddyPress, and was a focused experiment imagined and implemented by CUNY's Matt Gold as part of a NEH Start-Up grant he secured (just the beginning of his grant dynasty ?? ). Looking for Whitman was a ""grand, aggregated experiment"" that ran throughout the Fall of 2009 and used this very infrastructure to connect five courses at four distinct institutions around the work and life of Walt Whitman. [Quick aside: if you follow the this link you'll find I began to realize Twitter was a far better solution than trying to replicate it on a community site, but was still straddling both options due to faculty pushback.] An approach Mike Caulfield has been revisiting lately with the idea of topic or issue-based, cross-institutional collaboration that I agree with him has been a shamefully underexplored area of web-based possibilities:  > What if instead of setting hubs up under the ""course"" umbrella, we set them up by ""topics"" or ""issues""? What if instead of encouraging faculty to set up ANTH-301.xxxx.xxx, I encouraged them to set up global-issues-in- media.issuehubs.com? And then what if we made minor alterations to the structure of the hub that made it really easy for another class working on a similar or related subject to live in the same place? Without ever explicitly coordinating with the initial class?  Mike provides a contemporary state of the union for the ongoing evolution of these course (or issue/topic) specific hubs that are still very much in the early stages of being streamlined so that anyone can set them up easily. Making them simple both technically and conceptually is what I want to work on in earnest this semester with folks like Mike, Martha Burtis, Tim Owens, Ryan Brazell, Martin Hawksey, and Alan Levine (amongst many others). Special thanks to Mike Caulfield for the push, who says blogging is dead?  I'll end this already too long post with the other inspiration to write this postmortem of Reading Capital. Nine months ago I let the readingcapital.org domain lapse after archiving all the files. I cleared the decommissioning with Chris Caruso, who I considered my partner in the endeavor. He responded as supportively as ever:  > Thanks for the heads up. Seems okay to let it expire, though I do think it was a worthy experiment.  Indeed, it was. In fact, this entire post was useful to document how many little experiments and percieved ""failures"" were, in retrospect, worthy experiments that ultimately moved us towards what has become a genre of web- based learning: distributed open, online course hubs ? which are also deeply indebted to the early MOOC experiments, particularly Downes and Siemen's CCK08.  How else do I know Reading Capital was a worthy experiment? Well, my recently resurrected RSS Reader notified me readingcapital.org has a new occupant (which I can't bring myself to link to). A fairly shiny splog has setup shop on that domain and offers financial advice about all things capital. The deep irony is not lost on me, and didn't Alan Levine write recently about this being, in some peverted way, a compliment of sorts?  "Jim Groom,Reclaim Workshop,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-workshop/,1/21/2014,"I was invited to give a talk at the Sloan-Consortium's 7th Annual Emerging Technologies for Online Learning. I'll be talking about Domain of One's Own, Reclaim Hosting, web thinking, and some of the amazing possibilities we're starting to see emerge as a result of the work we've done thus far. In fact, Jon Udell's recent post about names and meaning when it comes to URLs ties nicely into the idea Martha Burtis had regarding naming your own domain as a metaphysical endeavor. This semester is going to be all Domain all the time, and for that I'm very excited. I'll be giving a playful, experimental version of this talk in Atlanta for the Domain Incubator at Emory University in just over a week. And while the two presentations will be distinct talks, I have an idea of trying to incorporate revanchist 1980s NYC b-movie themes into both ? but we'll see if that works. Actually, it doesn't really matter what I talk about because the real gold for the Domain Incubator conference, as Tim Owens just announced, will be the open and forkable documentation on Github that will narrate how the entire Domain of One's Own project has been setup, run, and maintained.  Anyway, the good folks organizing the Sloan conference also gave me the opportunity to run a workshop. I jumped at the chance because I want to see if I can't get a roomful of folks not only up and running on Reclaim Hosting , but also comfortable with manging their own slice of a web server and various applications in two or three hours. I think I can, and this workshop is going to be the test. Anyway, below is the description I submitted, and I would love any feedback. Would your sign-up for this workshop if you read the description? Does this sound like something a faculty member, technologist, or adminsitrator might even be interested in? I want to start getting at the idea that setting up your own domain and web host is not jsut abut a protfolio (though it's that too) , but it's a portal into a broader approach to thinking like the web at the personal, communal, and institution scale.  > This workshop will provide attendees a focused session to get up and running with your own domain name and web hosting account. By the end of this session you will have gotten the following:  >  >    Your own domain name (i.e. jimgroom.com)  >    Your own web hsoting account (with instruction of how to manage it)  >    Instructions for installing at least one open source application on your web server (such as WordPress, Omeka, etc.)  >    Instructions for publishing original content to your space.  >  > Sounds crazy, right? But it's not, taking control of your online presence and managing your own domain and web space has never been easier. The goal of this workshop is to provide faculty, technologists, and administrators a hands-on overview of how the web works from the inside-out. In a moment when everyone is talking about controlling your data, learning to code, and web literacy ? a sandbox space like this is invaluable for taking the first steps in truly interrogating how to think like the web.  "Richard V. Hurley,A Place of One's Own  ?  Online,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-v-hurley/a-place-of-ones-own-onlin_b_4109566.html,1/23/2014,"I've been writing in these pages about the intersection of technology and pedagogy at colleges of the liberal arts and sciences. I've essentially been arguing that although America needs technicians and technocrats, and though that may seem where the jobs are these days, the value of a liberal arts and sciences education cannot be underestimated. But I also think that liberal arts institutions must recognize that they are well into the 21st century, the ""digital age."" The technology of today, if it is used effectively, can be a great asset and lever for teaching. And it is incumbent on us at the universities to give our students the tools to succeed in our web-based world. Already, our students come to the University of Mary Washington as inhabitants and consumers of cyberspace. Cyberspace is where they share ideas, seek entertainment, communicate, search for information and answers. We need to help them use that space better, even master it if that is possible. For years, Mary Washington has had a very successful blogging platform. It has been used for classwork, to create literary journals, for student reports on their travel abroad, for club postings, and for alumni bulletin boards. It now has 8,500 users. But recently we came up with a potentially more exciting idea. We call it ""Domain of One's Own."" The Domain of One's Own initiative urges and coaches our students to set up their own individual websites. The initiative was propelled by several related ideas: The first was that students could use their sites to host, show, and promote their scholarship and research. The websites could serve as digital portfolios showcasing the students' resumes and best academic work for potential employers. And students would carry these URLs with them well beyond graduation. Second, the very act of building a website would be a great learning experience - it would allow students to grapple with how things are created on the web. And it would teach students how to create websites for others, an important and marketable skill. Third, for those whose ideas really take flight, the student domains would be the digital presentation of themselves, a way to explore their digital identities. They would not just be a marketing tool but a way for students and graduates to put their ideas, thoughts, writing, poetry, music, and videos, out there for others to contemplate, to respond to, or just enjoy. Domain of One's Own started as a pilot project in 2012 with 400 students participating. This year we rolled it out for the entire incoming freshman class. Mary Washington pays for every new freshman to acquire his or her own domain name and the university contracts for Wordpress and web hosting. If what our first users have done on the web is predictive, the initiative will be a great success. Hassan Halim, from the class of 2010, created a site called http://hirehassan.com, his online portfolio. ""I saw people printing out resumes, but I put everything online,"" he said. ""And I put my website on my card so people could find it."" Hassan also used his website building experience to create sites for others, including sites for a school board candidate and a Psi Upsilon fraternity chapter, and he created other personal sites to show his videos and his writing. Caitlin Murphy, a 2012 graduate, created http://caitlinpringlemurphy.com/ as a self-marketing tool and used it for all of her job applications. If you get a chance to view the site, you will see that it is well-organized and has a fresh, clean look. Caitlin is sure it helped her land her job at PBS: ""The woman interviewing me said she'd been impressed by my website and it was one of the reasons she called me."" One of our 2013 graduates, Haley Campbell, saw virtually no limit to what could be done. Her site, at http://aetherbunny.com, holds her college work and scholarship, personal musings and ramblings, daily writing, her videos and photographs. Haley said she had wanted to do something like this for some time but did not have the money or the time to do it on her own. She also created an art and literary journal online called http://stitchjournal.com which she shows as part of her resume. ""Having the skills to create a website using a Wordpress platform is extremely valuable to many employers,"" she says. She just started working to improve the website of a campground association. The University of Mary Washington has been lauded for this digital initiative, and it has been written that we are the first university to do this. We certainly hope that others pick up on the idea. Jim Groom, our Director of Teaching and Learning Technologies, puts it this way: ""We want to make emerging technologies central to the university experience, not an afterthought. We are building the web into the fabric of how we teach and learn here."" "Jim Groom,Digital Scholars Institute,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-scholars-institute/,1/26/2014,"Image by Kyle Bean: ""The Future of Books.""  One of the more exciting things to grow out of the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative ? the second cohort starts this week! ? is Mary Kayler's beautiful brainchild the Digital Scholars Institute. The Digital Scholars Institue is a way to continue the work started in the faculty initiative for those interested in sharing out the digital projects they are working on.  It's a way to bring a small group of faculty (5-7) together to talk about what they're currently working on in the digital realm. The institute can provide a space for faculty to share the details of their work, get feedback from their peers, and publish their ongoing reflections at the end of the year. We're roughly thinking of this being a series of 5-7 meetings a semester, each of which discusses one faculty member's digital project (kind of like a dissertation group). They'll be a cohort of faculty that continues to provide feedback, support, and critique (online and off) so we can begin to more formally codify the identity we have fashioned as a university of the digital liberal arts amongst our faculty.  Mary and I have the pleasure of working with professors Sue Fernsebner and Betsy Lewis to frame this institute out, and hopefully it will be up and running soon. These are exciting times at UMW, and what's been crystal clear to us at DTLT is that it all starts with faculty development. Last year we had 30 people sign-up for the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative, this year we had another 19. Add to that 5-7 faculty continuing on with the Digital Scholars Insitute, and you've got just about 50 faculty (out of roughly 215) that have been experimenting with what's possible through umwdomains ? that's awesome. Onward and upward!  "Jim Groom,Technical Vistas: Flat Files and APIs,http://bavatuesdays.com/technical-vistas-flat-files-and-apis/,1/26/2014,"It's been an exciting time at DTLT for a bunch of reasons, not least of which is that the Domain of One's Own project, much like the Death Star, has been fully operational for more than a semester now. We've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't, and we have much more to learn this semester. We'll be sharing out what we learned in more detail shortly, but in short: curricular integration is king.  Moving beyond the cultural work we're working towards with Domain on campus, there's some technical stuff we've been exploring that's pretty exciting. I've already wrote about the student coding projects we're working on with professor Karen Anewalt's Software Engineering course which should bare much fruit in the way of WordPress plugins for Domain of One's Own and UMW Blogs. The other technical stuff we've been experimenting with is sharing our documentation for Domain of One's Own. Tim Owen's recently wrote a post about how he is using the open source application DokuWiki and Github to allow anyone interested to fork our documentation. What's cool is that the synching between these two applications is possible because DokuWiki is using flat file storage. It very well may be that flat file CMSs will be all the rage in 2014, and far so good for us when it comes to wikis. Props to Audrey Watters for seeing the potential of Github well before the rest of us edtech hacks caught on.  The push for this setup on DokuWiki came out of our shared frustration with MediaWiki, talk about an application that wants you to hate it. And despite it's inclination to become a spam farm within an hour of installation, I was still prepared to stay in that abusive relationship if only for the great work the UBC folks have done with WordPress plugins like Wiki Embed. But Tim and Ryan Brazell challenged my backsliding, and proved me very wrong. I'll happily eat crow for those two geniuses.  Kin Lane #4life  The other thing that's got our attention as of late are APIs. Kin Lane is my hero in many regards, and his prosthletizing work for APIs has opened up a whole new world to us over the last year. I've known about APIs for a while, and had some vague idea of their value, but its Kin who framed for us their endless possibilities. Tim Owens has led the charge in the experimentation (he's DTLT's R&D), and he recently wrote a post ""Harnessing the Power of APIs"" that chronciles some of his early experiments. We are still in the early stages of this one, but as TIm eloquently notes:  > There's something magical about realizing that you can interact with almost any piece of software out there and build great things. There have been many instances where we've relied on RSS in our department to handle the bulk of the work of getting information from other systems. It's ""old reliable"" in that regard, but riddled with its own issues (the future of it notwithstanding). More often than not services are not including RSS as a part of their core offering (and in some cases it probably doesn't even make sense). But public APIs are commonplace and in most cases you can accomplish some really incredible stuff using them!  RSS is old gold, but might we need to invest more time and energy into APIs for making some of the work we are doing more seamlessly integrated? Tim was recently talking about providing a preliminary dashboard for all Domain of One's Own users that enables them to get a domain, create a subdomain, and install an application without ever going to CPanel ? all with APIs. Making things that much easier for our community to create and manage there own spaces is very powerful, and I'm stoked Tim is leading us in that direction.  DTLT, we're not the best for nothing. NOBODY!  Also, I have to quickly note that meeting Kin Lane and Audrey Watters last April at M.I.T. to start imagining Reclaim Your Domain has proven to be truly inspiring for the work we've been doing this year. I can't speak for anyone else in DTLT, all of whom are smarter than me and probably saw these developments on the rise, but I desparately needed a good schooling on flat- file CMSs, Github, APIs, and the future of the web.  OK, but enough of that, I'm off to read Roy Fielding's dissertation.  "Jim Groom,Student Coded Projects for DTLT,http://bavatuesdays.com/student-coded-projects-for-dtlt/,1/26/2014,"This semester students in Karen Anewalt's Software Engineering course (CPSC 430) will be working with DTLT to create a series of WordPress plugins/themes for UMW Blogs and Domain of One's Own. This is pretty awesome because we could always use some development, and it gives these students experience working with clients who need particular functionality for an open source application.  Traditionally students in this course put a call out to the community for projects and built applications for any takers from scratch. This model had some success, but the issue with this approach was that there was no one to take care of the application after the students graduated. Under this new approach, DTLT will be maintaing whatever they program. Major kudos to Martha Burtis for coming up with this model as well as taking the lead on organizing it.  Below is a list of the projects we are asking the Computer Science students to develop. The descriptions are in italics and were written by Martha Burtis, I provide commentary following each description.  DokuWiki/WordPress Plugin   This plugin will scrape content off of DokuWiki wiki pages and re-display them within WordPress. Similar plugins already exist for MediaWiki, [namely Wiki Embed], and they may serve as models for development. Ultimately, when installed, the plugin should allow the site administrator to provide the address of DokuWiki install and then use shortcodes to embed specific DokuWiki content from that install on WordPress pages.  This plugin was motivated by the fact that DTLT has moved its documentation for Domain of One's Own to DokuWiki (we are finally breaking up with MediaWiki). What's more, the documentation is synched with GitHub so that anyone interested in using our documentation can simply fork it there. Tim Owens rocked out this whole setup over break, and I am blown away by how awesome it is. You can read his post ""Please Steal Domain of One's Own"" that breaks down his thinking and process ? so good. This plugin provides us with the last piece that MediaWiki provided us that DokuWiki doesn't, and these CS students will be contributing to at least two open source projects.  WP Install Packages      Image Credit: wright.edu  This plugin would allow users of Domain of One's Own to add additional packages of plugins/themes to their WordPress install. In addition to being able to select packages, they should also be able to choose plugins/themes/features a la carte, based on their specific needs. A system will also need to be created to allow us to manage the installation packages.  The work with packages for Domain of One's Own has already been blogged about by Martha, and this plugin would actually allow us to customize packages for specific courses. So if an art course needed a specific art portfolio setup or a faculty member wanted a syndication setup or a student wanted a professional portfolio this would provide all of these. What's more, this plugin woud allow folks to choose which features of each package they want. What's so important about this plugin is it starts to make the various options provided by Domain of One's Own that much easier for people to see, understand, and use.  Reddit-Style Reader for Domain of One's Own  This project would involve create a Reddit-style interface for viewing, commenting upon, and upvoting incoming content from Domain of One's Own. It could be built within WordPress, or in another standalone application.  This project is why I've been exploring Reddit in more detail recently, and it promises to help us build a sense of community around all the disparate work coming out of Domain of One's Own. By default we have every post from every domain pulling into umwdomains.com. What's more, we have been able to capture metadata like department, instructor, course, etc. So, theoretically, we can use tags to create a series of subreddits off the homepage of Domain of One's Own that allows people to dig down to posts by department, course, instructor, etc.  UMW Blogs Plugin Suite   Image credit: http://lornali.com/concise-list-seo-plugins-wordpress/  This project involves developing several smaller plugins to enhance functionality and capabilities specific to UMW's WordPress Multisite installation (UMW Blogs):     Enhanced Admin User and Site Search: Allow for searching of partial usernames and sitenames in the Network Admin backend.    Sitewide Comment Tracking: Allow users to keep track of their comments across multiple sites on the UMW Blogs network.    Enhanced Contextual Support: Provide additional contextual support and help across the network.    Instructor-Filtered View of Student Activity: Allow the instructor of a course to track student activity across the course/network.    Bulk User Import: Allow instructors to easily import a data file of a student roster to automatically add students to a site.  This is a list of plugins we would love to have for UMW Blogs. Stuff like Sitewide Comment Tracking used to exist, and might in sites like wpmudev ? but we like our plugins free when possible. That said, if you know of freely accessible plugins that provide any of these feature we'd be much obliged. If not, hopefully they'll be developed at UMW sometime soon.    I've already had two meetings with the students providing the specs for what we need with the Reddit-style theme, and I'm pretty psyched this is moving forward. I'll be sure to provide detaisl and updates as the projects materialize virtually.  "David Morgen & Pete Rorabaugh,"Building Community, Critical Literacies with Domain of One's Own Incubator",http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/building-community-critical-literacies-domain-ones-incubator/,1/28/2014,"In April, faculty and staff from fifteen universities in the Atlanta region (and beyond) will attend the Domain of One's Own Atlanta Regional Incubator hosted by Emory University's Writing Program. Jim Groom, Tim Owens, and Martha Burtis of the University of Mary Washington and Audrey Watters of Hack Education will provide keynote addresses. Co-organizers David Morgen (Emory University) and Pete Rorabaugh (Southern Polytechnic State University) offer this theoretical context for the Domain pilots at their respective campuses and their reasoning behind building a regional, cross- institutional pedagogical network to explore digital literacies.  In a recent conversation about Twitter in my (Pete's) ENGL 1102 class, one of my students observed that the way we were using Twitter in class was not ""what Twitter is for."" It was a revelation and led to our probing the idea of digital tools and how they're built for specific purposes. Observing that Twitter encourages short pieces of text, links, and self-promotion, the class came to the consensus that Twitter ""was meant for"" celebrities, advertising, and self-obsessed status updates. ""Twitter is about what you ïdo,' and not so much about what you think,"" one student asserted. True or not, it was a meaningful capture of the resistance that I encounter when I introduce a class to social media in general and Twitter in particular. Everyone is familiar with memes, hoaxes, and selfies on social media; in many ways, that's how some of us are trained to see social media. Yet, from the culture of coding we learn that any tool can be hacked and repurposed. User agency modifies the tool, changing what it can be for and unlocking its potential.  Academics exploring the values of social media, connected learning, and network-building in and beyond classrooms (concrete and digital) have been hacking these tools for years. Twitter, in particular, provides an open space that we can populate with ideas and interaction, where real-life experience can merge with research, and where collaborative thinking can germinate. In American universities most of us don't often encounter students who are ""new to the web."" We do, however, encounter plenty of students who are new to this kind of web and this kind of approach to interaction. Significantly, most students haven't been taught to think about how the natures of knowledge, authority, composition, and learning have changed/are changing. The Internet provides digital spaces and applications that are ripe for redefinition in ways that many educational structures have not reconciled.  One of the more active exploratory approaches to digital learning comes from a collection of (mostly) Canadian scholars who have been defining ""connectivism"" as a learning theory (for a thorough orientation, see Stephen Downes's Connectivism and Connected Knowledge). Connectivist educators, mostly working in variously defined departments of Education (Bonnie Stewart, Dave Cormier, Stephen Downes, George Siemens, and Alec Couros as examples), built and worked within the first MOOCs in 2008. These experimental courses (CCK08, Change11, and ETMOOC are good examples) are now known as cMOOCs to differentiate them from the corporate varieties, a distinction that's well explained in Sir John Daniel's ""Making Sense of MOOCs: Musings in a Maze of Myth, Paradox and Possibility.""  In 2010, Jim Groom and University of Mary Washington's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies began tinkering with ownership and student agency with Domain of One's Own, educating students and faculty about the essential building blocks of the web and encouraging them to take an active role in the construction of their own digital identity. Domain of One's Own, which in fall 2013 began providing all incoming first-year students at UMW with their own domains, has received attention in Wired and the Chronicle of Higher Education, for its user-centered approach to digital creation.  UMW's Domain of One's Own initiative offers a possible link between the experimental workings of a connectivist MOOC and an on-ground or hybrid course offered at an institution. The move toward hybridity goes both ways, and while higher education has been mostly exploring how to export a serviceable replica of face-to-face culture into online space (short answer: we can't, and that culture has to be re-imagined in a fresh context) some of us have been interested in taking the networked values of viable online communities and dragging them across the boundary into our classrooms. Bonnie Stewart's article ""Massive + Openness = New Literacies of Participation"" gestures toward the potential unintended benefits of the last several years' worth of MOOC furor. ""Even if many models of MOOC reflect attempts by elite gatekeeping institutions and corporate interests to maintain control, market dominance, and the right to determine what counts as knowledge (see ""The Problem with EdX""), MOOCs may nonetheless serve as a Trojan horse for the sociocultural development of participatory perspectives and literacies."" The attention that cMOOCs have brought to connected theories of knowledge provide useful grounding for the digital experimentation and critical awareness inherent in Domain of One's Own, a project that Groom shares with Tim Owens and Martha Burtis at UMW. Domain has solved practical problems at UMW in the way that cMOOCs have revised online learning. According to Groom, Domain ""provides a link between EdTech and Digital Humanities . . . and can be part of a larger re-imagining of a culture of teaching and learning."" Both projects depend on a critical attention to what Stewart calls ""participatory perspectives and literacies.""  Doug Belshaw's The Neverending Thesis explores the soup of terms that have been used to describe user fluency in online spaces  ?  information literacy, media literacy, print/visual literacy, and computer literacy (""The History of ïdigital literacy'"")  ?  and also explores dual approaches to the definition of ""literacy,"" one in which we develop the technical skills required for ""reading"" and another wherein that is ""post-typographical and metaphorical,"" the way ""a footballer might be said to ïread' a game"" (""New Literacies""). Belshaw, along with many others (from Anna Smith to Howard Rheingold to The New London Group), have argued for a view of literacies as a plural concept that extends beyond character decoding and extends to publishing prowess, presentation skills, and the interpretation of things like memes and platforms. Belshaw writes in his Neverending Thesis that literacy is ""a condition, not a threshold.""  Before we develop agency, students and teachers must become aware. Before attending to how authorship and control work on the web (demonstrated by the language of Terms and Conditions agreements), teachers and learners may not see the importance of control of one's own domain. However, knowing that Facebook, Twitter, and Google mine our documents and posts for their monetization potential can be eye-opening to students who have grown up labeled (or misunderstood) as ""digital natives."" The companies on whose platforms we connect and through whose servers we run demonstrate varying levels of openness or exploitation, but they are companies whose primary focus is profit. They are embedded in political and economic tides (as we all are to varying degrees) that benefit from the impression that much of what we use online is ""free."" Domain of One's Own takes the approach that large corporations are not the only ones that can assert agency on the web (something many of us have known for years, but fewer have practiced) and that students who develop digital literacies begin to see the web differently, as less of a consumer space and one more useful for meaningful learning and interaction. When we have to come to terms with the conditions under which corporations own parts of our digital selves, it is often disturbing.  This awareness is one step toward empowerment. Henry Giroux addresses such an approach in a recent article on Truthout: ""Education must be considered central to any viable notion of politics. This suggests that progressives make clear how cultural apparatuses and media sources work pedagogically to produce market-driven subjects who are summoned to inhabit the values, dreams and social relations of an already established repressive social order."" With digital media though, as with the process of formal education writ large, a critique of corporate ownership cannot be useful without a pedagogy of hope. In On Critical Pedagogy Giroux writes, ""while it is important to politicize the process of schooling . . . what is also needed to supplement this view is an ennobling imaginative vision that takes us beyond the given and commonplace"" (39). Critical educators have navigated this space of educational empowerment for decades, and the lessons of that discourse give us the foundation from which to begin addressing digital literacies  ?  as conditions, limits, and affordances. Just as the best college composition courses have always encouraged students beyond the narrow expectations of academic writing conventions, so too does a critically aware approach to digital literacy empower us all in our work and play online.  In the overlap between Belshaw and Giroux, educators can develop a pedagogy of critical digital literacies that both cultivates an awareness of the technological, social, and economic underpinnings of digital space and empowers students to act with agency and creativity there. Domain of One's Own offers an ongoing experiment in conveying digital literacies in a broad, programmatic sense in much the way that ""Writing Across the Curriculum"" programs have made campuses aware of the broad value of interdisciplinary approaches to composition. The most frequent application of Domain involves students building and maintaining WordPress platforms on their webspaces, establishing themselves first and foremost like authors. Of course, Domain can operate on a individual classroom level in much the same way that many digitally-minded faculty have been using blogging for over a decade (the program for the 2004 Conference on College Composition and Communication reveals close to a dozen sessions related to blogging, digital literacies, and multimodal composition); but a Domain approach, or something like it, also offers departmental or program-level attention to digital literacies, interdisciplinary research opportunities, and a stronger commitment to faculty development opportunities.  And this literacy development is not just an exercise in the life of the mind. There are implications beyond the academy for these students, who can take their experiences in the classroom into the non-academic workplace. As William Pannapacker argues in ""No More Digitally Challenged Liberal-Arts Majors,"" graduates who can point to experience with web design, adaptability, ""boot- strapping,"" teamwork, and presentation skills are well-prepared with agency when leaving the university to find a job. Pannapacker writes, ""Evidence of teamwork ? the ability to work collaboratively on large projects with different kinds of people ? is extremely important, along with time management and the skill to juggle multiple tasks. Employers also want people who can work with data and statistics and are able to make lucid arguments, using spreadsheets and visualizations, that are grounded in quantitative ways of thinking."" A critical and practical exposure to digital literacies on a broad, programmatic level, can move students towards fluency in these areas in addition to exposing them to connected learning methodologies.  Part of the power of a program like Domain of One's Own, from Emory University's faculty development perspective, is that I (David) encourage faculty who might otherwise be reticent to tackle this sort of teaching with technology by fostering two different learning networks for the faculty to engage with: faculty are making with their students, and so become part of a learning network with them, and faculty are part of an even larger learning network along with the others who have joined the Domain program. At Emory, I have found numerous faculty who are excited about the ways in which Domain solves pedagogical problems for them, but who don't feel ""tech savvy"" enough to have tackled this sort of work on their own.  Our intention in developing the Atlanta Regional Domain of One's Own Incubator, happening in Atlanta in February 2014, is to create an even wider network of digital collaborators and to explore multiple pedagogical applications of Domain. In engaging the Atlanta DH/D-Ped network, we've involved faculty whose skills are all over the tech spectrum, from digital project curators to freshly curious graduate student teaching assistants (though sometimes those descriptors refer to the same person). On both the UMW and Emory campuses, Domain grows from the ground up  ?  students come asking for domain space out of a particular need or faculty members express interest in how to ""Domain"" their classes. Both schools cultivate a network of faculty partners by offering one-on-one support meetings, weekly trainings, and other forms of professional development. This month's Incubator proposes that work on a larger scale, involving 60 faculty, staff, and graduate students from an eclectic mix of campus environments in two days of discussion and collaboration on how Domain might answer pedagogical questions for them. Domain is flexible  ?  it's a methodology, not a ""tool""  ?  and we're hopeful that Domain Incubator attendees will find teaching ideas, potential collaborators, a pedagogical support structure, and Domain implementation guidance adaptable to their own campus. Ultimately, we are helping to build a regional network that is self-sustaining  ?  a diverse collective of pedagogical hackers.  One benefit of Emory's iteration of Domain of One's Own as a program is that it doesn't just reach the usual suspects who are already on board with Stewart, Belshaw, or Giroux. It attracts progressive educators who are new to digital pedagogy. Our aim for the Domain Incubator is to advance that goal in a regional sense, building learning networks for those of us who are creating and administering programs that value critical and digital literacies. We look forward to reporting back on the many great ideas that hatch from the Atlanta Domain Incubator.

I'm slipping. I love that the article was published in an IT management-centered publication. IT management might not be our particular focus at DTLT ? we're all about the teaching and learning ? but that's part of the genius of Domain of One's Own: it's protean. And this isn't the first time a more business- centered publication picked this initiative up, last semester Nicole Henderson wrote an article about UMW Domains on the Web Host Industry Review. The author of the article for University Business, Matt Zalaznick, talked with Tim ""the wizard"" Owens about the project, and it all sounds so good:  > The tools provided by the ""Domain of One's Own"" initiative make it easier for students to carve out their own space on the web, and control and customize itƒ  >  > ""Students want to make something their own ? to personalize it and say this is my space, this is who I am, in a way to personify themselves on the web,"" Owens says.  >  > Users have complete control over the content and the design of the page. Mary Washington students can install a variety of open source software, such as the blogging platform WordPress, to help them design their sites.  Exactly, these three paragraphs really get at why someone at University Business or Web Hosting Industry Review or some other solutions-minded publication would be interested in Domain of One's Own ? because it is an amazing solution to have university communities thinking more critically about how the web works. It provides a space for students (as well as faculty and staff) to experiment with their web presence through the university, but not necessarily on it.  Enabling an academic community to experiment with a wide range of open source applciations (like WordPress, Omeka, Mahara, Moodle, MediaWIki, DokuWIki, etc.) is built into the design of UMW Domains. This isn't a unilateral, campus-wide approach to a singe tool, an approach often taken with most content management, learning management, and e-portfolio systems, and one that often breeds mutiny in pockets. This is a platform that enables and encourages experimentation of possibilities and a diversity of options. Such an approach recognizes the university campus as a lab that can simultaneously be virtualized, de-centered, and personalized.  UMW Domains provides myriad opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to once again imagine the work they do at and for their university as part of a broader set of resources and conversations the campus community can and should be publishing on the web. The general neglect of campus provided web spaces (remember the /~space) as part of a university's web infrastructure could very well mean that less and less personal, pedagogical, and scholarly work is freely published as part of that community despite the fact that the tools have never been easier. This isn't to say the work won't still be published on the web, but it'll be all over the place providing no unified sense of a networked community with a shared sense of purpose that in many ways defines what a university community is. Why would we let the very core of our mission languish so?  And we haven't even gotten to the points of controlling one's data in the era of the NSA Spygate (this is not a conspiracy, we actually all know this now), interrogating how the web works, learning the inner workings of web hosting and open source tools that can make students more marketable, etc. Why isn't everyone considering something like this? It seems to me we have a lot more to lose than to gain by not doing it. No, I guess we would rather just build or lease huge virtual auditoriums that seat tens of thousands of people and show videos because the web is just an amphitheater and ebooks are the popcorn ??  Today I sat down with one of the many great professors at UMW. As we got started, rather than telling her to sign-up for a blog on our system ? something I have been doing for eight years now ? she logged into her own web hosting account and started exploring CPanel, creating subdomains, editing files in the file manager, and installing an open source software ? all before we even got to the tool. This was an awesome moment for me professionally. At UMW we have evolved with the technology and we're bringing our community along. We've built several layers of what some folks might refer to as ""work"" into the process, but it's work that people want to do because they want to try and understand how the web works. UMW Domains provides them a place to start from; a space to manage, archive, and explore what it means to be sysadmins of their education.  What's more, because this professor was part of the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative, we actually started talking about Vaneveer Bush's Memex, Doug Engelbart's ""Mother of All Demoes,"" and Jon Udell's ""Seven Ways to think like the Web"" while doing it. That's a professional peak for me ?? The Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative kicked off this week with 19 faculty, and you can see the first week's curriculum here. In just about a year we've gotten almost 70 tenure-track and administrative faculty their own domain. It's all the rage!  In fact, instead of sitting here writing this in my den, Martha Burtis, Tim Owens, and I should have been in Atlanta tonight preparing to attend the three-day Domain Incubator that was set to start tomorrow. Unfortunately, because of the snow and ice it has been rescheduled for two weeks from now in mid-February (the 13th and 14th). This event will bring together a number of regional faculty from a variety of universities in the Atlanta region who are ready to experiment with their own domain projects. In fact, Pete Rorbaugh and David Morgen published an excellent article in Hybrid pedagogy yesterday in which they framed the theoretical context for building a cross-institutional community around web literacies at this moment.  Add to all of that a meeting DTLT had at the beginning of the week with our Provost. He asked to meet to get a better sense of the project so that he could start explaining its broader technical and conceptual possibilities to others ? and he gets it. It's truly been an awesome week for Domain of One's Own. The press is writing about it, the academic communities are theorizing it, administration is groking it, and DTLT is rocking it. It's a win-win, baby! I feel like I am living in the ds106zone!  "Jim Groom,A Study in ds106,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-study-in-ds106/,1/29/2014,"Howard Rheingold has written an excellent case study of ds106 as an example of open and particpatory learning for the Connected Learning community. I've worked a bit with Howard this past year, and it's an absolute joy to collaborate with him. He truly groks ds106, and he also deeply understand the value of a community is that it doesn't center around any one thing or person, and this is sometimes what eludes folks when trying to either make sense of or, even more dangerously, explain ds106. It's a distributed community that has many moving technical and corporeal parts, seasons, moods, and people. This case study does an unbelievable job of trying to do justice to as many of those complexities as possible.  I'm really greatly indebted to Howard for promoting the work so many of us have been doing with communities like ds106, Domain of One's Own, and Reclaim Hosting. He's a tireless creator with enough good energy to go around. He embodies one of the greatest single affordances of the web ? broadcasting the honest celebration of the ideas, things and people he enjoys. Which, interestingly enough, is also at the heart of ds106, and which may explain some of the mutual attraction between that community and Howard. Anyway, this is jsut to say that I think he's truly groovy. And when I say groovy, I mean Bruce Campbell GROOVY!  "Jim Groom,Talking Domains at DML2014,http://bavatuesdays.com/talking-domains-at-dml2014/,1/30/2014,"Below is a four minute video clip for the upcoming Digital Media & Learning Conference, ""Connecting Practices."" The conference is in Boston from March 6-8, and I'll be part of a featured panel alongside the great Jonathan Worth, of Phonar fame, titled ""Open Technologies for Learning."" Philip Schmidt put this panel together, and I'm looking forward to starting to frame out more specifically how ""Domain of One's Own"" is the ultimate open technology for learning. In the following preview of the discussion Howard Rheingold gets me going on a bit of domains tear, and there will problably be a lot more of that in March. I have to point out that Howard did not miss the chance to push ds106. He's #4life! Did I mention I'm all domains all the time now?

"Jim Groom,UMW Domains goes Back to School,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-goes-back-to-school/,1/31/2014,"Kim Jaxon and Patrick Berry had a compelling conversation as part of their most recent Back to School podcast about the fact that more and more faculty and students want alternatives to the centralized, campus-supported learning management system. The larger question they get at is why aren't universities thinking more creatively ? and this goes for IT, academic departments, and individual faculty alike ? about providing more options for their campus community.  This is very much inline with the thinking we've been doing at UMW, and I agree with them wholeheartedly that this stuff isn't crazy. Providing faculty, staff, and students with web hosting space to explore the web, publish freely, and share resources as part of the unviersity experience should be at the core of its mission. Nevertheless, ever since universities abandoned evolving the shared web tilda spaces (~jgroom) they've provided little to nothing in their stead. What's crazy about this (and this is what's really nuts to me!), is that it's only gotten more important to create and define a professional presence on the web. UMW Domains speaks precisely to this reality.  Kim and Pat, let us know how we can help you over at CSU Chico. Also, there's this little thing called Reclaim Hosting we came up with to make this possibility a quick and cheap reality for any interested faculty and/or student who want something like Domain of One's Own, but don't have the internal support to get it for whatever reason.  Also, Patrick Berry consistently cracked me up throughout this podcast, I love his sense of humor.  "Jim Groom,Analog Futures,http://bavatuesdays.com/analog-futures/,2/2/2014,"Earlier this week I read Vannevar Bush's seminal 1945 essay ""As We May Think."" It was as remarkable as I had heard in terms of his ability to predict the future, and I was amazed at just how many kernels of current technical and communciation realities it contained. Like Doug Engelbart's ""Mother of All Demoes"" which introduced the computer mouse, word processing, networked video calls, and hyperlinks all in an hour an a haf, Bush's essay maps out everything from the future of photography, wearable computing, credit card machine, wireless communications, Wikipedia and the web more generally, which Bush refers to as the Memex. It's an essay with a remarkable range of registers, from technical to practical to hopeful, and its that last one that was so inspiring for me while reading.  This article is just as much a historical document as it is a roadmap for the future. Written in 1945 it breifly frames the previous five years of intesive war-time scientific research dedicated to mass destruction (in the form of the Atom Bomb) as a turning point for civilization. Rather than continuing down this path, Bush himself effectively ran the militiary industrial complex during WWII in the U.S., the post-war moment provids the opportunity to direct that collaborative research momentum to transform the way humanity communicates. Re-think how we share information, solve problems, and provide ""a record of ideasƒ.so that knowledge survives and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual."" It's powerful because it helps to position Bush, and after him Engelbart, in a tradition of the internet (and later the web) that is first and foremost grounded in the idea of sharing as much of the world's knowledge as widely and openly as possible.  Connecting the history of the internet and new media with Bush and Engelbart immediately frames it as a deeply humane, noble pursuit that is, paradoixically, born out of and continually developed through and/or alongside the militiary industrial complex. That immediate tension still very much exisits remains, and id one of the more fascinating elements of internet history I hope comes across this week in the Internet Course.  The other part of Bush's essay that fascinates me to no end is how he is pushes up against the limits of what's possibly through analog technology. This essay provides an excellent opportunity to talk with a class of students about the difference between analog and digital technologies, and what that has meant for the future of computing and culture. When Bush talks about the Memex, he imagines it as a ""sort of mechanized private file and library"" storing ""all his books, records, and communiations."" What's more, it's a system that can be fit within a desk consisting of milliosn of compressed records on microfilm that can be immediately retrieved and linked to create a web of trails that the user follows.  Image of Vannever Bush's imagined ""Memex""  As Bush lays down the entire vision, it's obvious he's describing what we would call the web at almost every point, the only difference between his vision and our reality is that it would ultimately be accomplished through digital, not analog, computers. His vision of an analog Memex of microfilm wouldn't have been practical because it explodes at the point of seamlessly linking various resources and breaking out of the linear continuity of analog information. Therein is the magic of digital information, it's discontinuous. The digital enables the web trails that Bush discusses that cut across any one logical and continuous system to emerge by transmuting resources into binary packets of information that can be transmitted easily.  I spoke to this point a bit last Tuesday when teaching this essay, and I wonder if it might not be just as useful for the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiaitve folks who read ""As We May Think,"" as well as watched Engelbart's demo. What does it mean to be a ""digital"" scholar in this regard? The term is used pretty liberally now, but how do we start to very specificaly map it onto the work we are doing in higher ed? Both Bush and Engelbart seem to share the basic principle that the emerging communication technology that would become the internet is premised on one thing above all others: ""augmenting human intellect."" How does that fit in with the way we use it?  "Jim Groom,Master of My Domain,http://bavatuesdays.com/master-of-my-domain/,2/7/2014,"Image credit: Andy Rush caught me in my Walt Whitman B'Hoy stance  We are going full throttle at UMW with Domain of One's Own, so it's time to bust out the t-shirt! Mary Kayler got me this gem for Christmas, and I am wearing it with pride today! We have nearly 600 domains registered, Martha and Tim have built the community site for UMW Domains (read about the details on Timmmmy Wonder's blog), that Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative is ruling, and this whole thing is starting to feel even more exhilarating than UMW Blogs did seven years ago. DTLT is operating in the clouds right now, and I'm really thankful to be part of it. I might be master of my domain, but I hope that doesn't belie just how much a collective effort realizing this awesomeness has always been. I'm very happy right now. I couldn't be prouder of the work DTLT is doing and I love UMW more every day ? this place truly does rock!  "Jim Groom,Rainbow Dash on UMW Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/rainbow-dash-on-umw-domains/,2/7/2014,"I have another post I'll be writing about this week in The Internet Course, but one of the gems early on has been finally getting to meet and work with Amber May given she's in the course. I've known Amber's work for a while now given how strong she showed in Alan Levine's section of ds106 last Spring. Her voice acting is amazing, and I'm happy to hear she is exploring that across a number of courses at UMW, including Mark Snyder's MIDI course. Here's a recent song loop she created for that course which is hysterical.  All this to say, I was joking with her last week that we need to get together and have Rainbow Dash promote Domain of One's Own. And given that she's awesome and #4life the real deal was quickly delivered. If you're a Brony like me, you'll enjoy the latest promo for UMW Domains ? the greatest thing since My Little Pony ??  http://bavatuesdays.com/files/2014/02/RainbowDash-UMWDomains-Promo.mp3  "Jim Groom,What Richard Scarry has to Teach Us About Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/what-richard-scarry-has-to-teach-us-about-domains/,2/16/2014,"We've been rolling out Domain of One's Own this year at UMW, which means DTLT has been busy introducing it to faculty and students. I've been working on an anology over the last few months (I'm not sure it reaches the figurative height of mataphor) to try and help people understand how a domain and web hosting works. It would be easy for faculty and students to liken UMW Domains to getting a site on UMW Blogs, but part of the problem with that is they would miss out on so much of the power, freedom, and possibility Domain of One's Own offers.  So, here is my analogy that everyone at DTLT makes fun of me for, but that's just because they're jealous they didn't think of it first ??  Image Credit Rowan peter Peter Rowan  To start, a domain is to web hosting as a street address is to a house (domain:web hosting :: street address: house). In other words, just like a street address, a domain is an abstracted locator that points a visitor to a web server (or your virtual house) wherein you do your online living. In this analogy the server is like the house you live in. People can find it through the domain name that points them there, but the space where you create subdomains, install applications, repair databases, etc. is the web hosting. More specifically, it's a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your slice of shared server.  Now, some of you might be saying, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard that analogy before. Big whoop!"" Well, first of all, screw you! And second of all, I'm not done yet! Here is where the analogy get's all Richard Scarry on you. What does a house consist of? That's right, rooms. And why does it have different rooms? Exactly, to meet the specific needs of living. You don't sleep in the kitchen and you don't micturate in the living room, right? Right. Each room has it's particular purpose, and it provides a sense of structure and order to living within a house.  As the above cross-section of the Rabbit Family's house demonstrates, each room has a specific use: you sleep in the bedroom, cook in the kitchen, brush your teeth in the bathroom, etc. The house is made up of various rooms in which your live.  The same thing might be said about your online domain and web hosting. Through the web hosting account you can partition off your domain into various ""rooms"" that are utilized in different ways.  By using subdomains you can create a series of rooms within your ""online house"" so that you can install specific applications to accomplish various things. For example, you can create the subdomain photos.mydomain.com and install an image mangement application like Zen Photo to store and share your digital photographs. You can use files.mydomain.com to manage and store your documents online with OwnCloud. Why not create the subdomain rss.mydomain.com and install the RSS reader application Tiny Tiny RSS to follow all your favorite bogs. Are you an exhibitionist? Try exhibit.mydomain.com for an Omeka install. Have a picture of your cat and/or bad politics to share? Create blog.mydomain.com for a WordPress install and tell the world about both. These subdomains enable you to organize your online space by installing a variety of applications for your various reasons. It's once you realize this that you can truly begin to occupying your own domain.  Admit it, you are blown away!  "Jim Groom,Domains in the Afterglow,http://bavatuesdays.com/domains-in-the-afterglow/,2/22/2014,"Below is an abstract of the presentation I'll be giving at <del>Emory Unviersity as part of the Domain Incubator event this Friday (Valentine's Day!)</del> Baruch College at the end of March. I came up with it a couple of week's ago inspired by this presentation delivered by Bruce Sterling at the transmediale conference on January 29th. I already blogged about this presentation, but it got me thinking my talks about University of Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own project thus far have been primarily focused on the history of this project at UMW ? the localized evolution of the idea.  I'm hoping this presentation will help me contextualize Domain of One's Own within the broader history of the web. To accomplish this I'm going to be focusing on a specific web hosting community site of the early web: the now defunct Geocities. This is inspired by the art project ""One Terabyte in the Kilobyte Age"" which has archived a terrabyte of data from this discarded online datapolis. The images of these long forgotten ghost sites are remarkable, and speak volumes to the questions of how the web has changed? -who we are on the web over time? Not to mention it starts to underscore the fact that the web is an historical world that will itself have epochs. Virtual cities will rise and fall, and people will come and go. Who are we on the web in our moment, and how much of it is ours?  Below is the abstract I submitted to Luke Waltzer earlier this week. In addition to researching Geocities, I'm going to spend as much time as possible over the next month following up on a series of resources folks from all over North America shared with me about the evolution of personal web spaces on university servers during the 1990s. I'll be blogging on this theme pretty consistently over the next four weeks, so consider yourself warned.  > Domains in the Afterglow Or, What Can We Learn from Geocities about Digital Identity  >  > The motto of the recent 2014 media art conference transmedial was ""afterglow"" which, according to the organizers, ""symbolises the current state of digital culture ? somewhere between trash and treasure, between high-tech brilliance and electronic junk ? a culture of big-data firms and surveillance systems, where the digital revolution of yesterday has yielded media technologies that are rapidly consumed and discarded."" This talk will examine the state of the afterglow through the lens of an ongoing digital art project, One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age, that focuses on the web's first major build- your-own-site community hub: the now defunct Geocities. What can internet kipple from twenty years ago tell us about the current state of publishing, community, and identity on the web? What's more, how can it convince you to reclaim your domain?  "Jim Groom,Classes I want to teach,http://bavatuesdays.com/classes-i-want-to-teach/,2/25/2014,"One of the best things about my job at UMW is that I've been able to teach a wide range of courses across a few disciplines. So far I've taught nine different courses, and one of them six (soon to be seven) different times.     The Internet Course, Spring 2014 (with Paul Bond)    True Crime: America's Most Wanted, Fall 2013 (with Paul Bond)    Hardboiled: 20th Century US Detective Fiction, Fall 2012 (with Paul Bond)    Digital Storytelling (a.k.a. ds106), Spring 2010, Fall 2010, Spring 2011, Summer 2011 (The Summer of Oblivion), Spring 2012, and Summer 2013 (with DTLT and half the web)    Discipline & Punish: Early American Criminal Narratives, Summer 2007    Museum Interpretation and Design, Spring 2007 (<del>Class site)</del> Archived    English Composition, Fall 2006    Love, Time, and the Exotic in Literature, Summer 2006  As the list above illustrates, ever since ds106 I've been effectively co- teaching all my courses. First alongside Martha Burtis (and a host of characters in ds106), then Alan Levine, and more recently with Paul Bond. ds106 taught me how amazing collaborative teaching can be. What's more, the majority of collaborative work is done amongst adjuncts and/or staff that are doing this in addition to their day job for little or no pay. I'm looking forward to more and better collaborations for just about everything I'll be doing in the future. ds106 changed my life!  As for this post, it's just a way to jot down some courses I want to teach sometime in the relatively near future. I may never get the chance, but at least I'll have the record of my best intentions.  Pirates, Zombies, and Copyright   I've done a fullblown presentation and a series of blog posts about this course idea, but I still haven;t taught it. The idea would be to look at the cultural history of pirates and zombies over the last three hundred years leading up to their current re-valuation in contemporary culture as a popular frame for copyright. How does piracy and the zombie apocalypse inform the global discussion around international trade, undead labor, and the role of the state in protecting virutal property in the twenty-first century. This would make a fun Freshman Seminar or AMerican Studies special topics course, and I might propose it for next Spring is the stars align.  A National Film Registry MOOC   I've already written about this idea, but I still want to teach an open class about how the National Film Registry works and have tons of folks writing about film, creating propaganda campaigns to get their favorite films on the registry, and generally going nuts. This class is clear as day to me how awesome it could be because the possibilities are so rich and so varied. Here' s what I wrote:  > Right now I'm thinking the class could sample a few films from each genre chosen for preservation, and then ask some basic questions about how the criteria of ""artistically, culturally, and socially significant"" might be understood for a number of those filmsƒ.as of now there are 575 films on the National Film Registry's list, and if enough people play along with this class ? we might be able to cover quite a few of them within the wider community. I'll pull a few examples that I'll analyze and share out from each genre to talk about while using this as a way of encouraging others to pick a film on the list and share back their findings through their blog. I like how this allows for a lot of freedom and self-direction for anyone taking the course.  Whether or not I teach this course, it needs to be taught. In fact, it already may be, and if it is I am going to take it.  Domain of One's Own   DTLT has already framed the curriculum for this course as a part fo the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative. We would just need to bulk it up a bit for a fifteen week version. Ideally we would co-teach this as a group. I imagine it as a Freshman Seminar that could live in the Computer Science department. We could do one or two sections, and use it as way to dig deeper into the computational thinking/seven ways to think like the web literacy vision we've been talking about in relationship to UMW Domains.  Italy: the Years of Lead   I really, really want to teach a Freshman Seminar alongside Antonella about the social and political turmoil the rocked Italy for more than a decade from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, as called the Years of Lead. The focus would be on the 1970s in particular, looking at the various political, social, and cultural forces that led to unprecedented levels of all-out war on the streets of Italy between various political groups, the police, and organzied crime. One of the major themes of the course would be an examination of political terrorism in the 1970s, with the focal point being 1977. This cultural history would be framed through news media, literature, film, and TV. What's more, I can sneak in a whole genre of Italian b-movies known as Poliziottesco ?? We would need to do a lot more research for this one, but I hope we can pull thsi one off sometime soon.  The 1980s   I want to teach a course with GNA Garcia about the 1980s. I would want it to be a fullblown cultural memory course in which we would read, share, and discuss ona wide sereis of topics from the 198s. For example, a week or two dedicated to politics in the 1980s, a week to music in the 80s, film in the 80s, TV, fashion, computer culture, labor, videogames, etc. There would be a few particular texts, some listening parties, screenings, etc. I thinking about about it like a happening of the decade, a series of impressionistic approaches to trying to help a group of students born in the mid-90s gain a sense of the decade somewhat holistically. GNA and I are the 80s.  Sharks: A Cultural History   This might be best taught alongside a biologist (or a Tom Woodward) that specializes in sharks.This course would oscillate between the science and cultural imagination of this predatory species of fish. Since Jaws sharks have remained one of the most powerful icons of the world we live in ? providing a frame for our violent fascination with power, violence, and absurdity with everything from Wall Street to the internet. This class would chum a cultural trail to try and bait one of our most deeply seated fears: the invisible predator.  There are several more I want to teach like a course on Mario Bava's films (Paul Bond and I are ready for this one). A course about the politics of horror movies, and yet another class about film genres more generally to cut across film categories. There's also a course I taught at CUNY's Queens College on the literature of captivity narratives that I've been aching to revive in a new form. But, as is often the case, this post is already much too long and I have other work to do, so I'll stop it here for now. Hopefully they'll be a part two sometime soon so that I can spell a few of these out in more detail.     There are much larger issues with the devaluation of intellectual labor in highered, and the adjunct army is one major part of that complex. Part of the horror of that situation is who could afford to collaboratively teach on the wages offered? What's more, how can what many refer to as one of the most innovative approaches to teaching online (namely ds106) come out of a motley band of edtech geeks, staff, adjuncts, and other folks on the margins of what we consider the traditional academy?  "Jim Groom,UMW Domains-Now with More Community!,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-now-with-more-community/,2/27/2014,"Domain of One's Own has been an unqualified success, and Martha's post on this project provides a nice summary of where we are at six months in. We're on track to have more than 700 folks in the UMW community with their own domain and web hosting this academic year, and for 2014/15 we're shooting to double that number with an additional 1500 domains. Just think of it, 2200 people with their own domain by year two. That's almost half our campus community ? that's absolutely awesome. Unparalled in the known world ? we're the god damned Magellans of edtech!  But like any age of exploration, we have to start mapping this brave new worlds for beauteous mankind, and that's just what Martha Burtis and Tim Owens have been doing. Since the beginning of the semester they've been building a community hub for all of the distributed working happening on UMW Domains. Tim wrote about creating this space in some detail already, and it's amazing how the longstanding dream for many of us in edtech of ""eduglu"" (a syndication hub that could seamlessly pull feeds and tags from a variety of applications) has become a reality for us at UMW once we abstracted beyond dependence on one particular application. The Community site for UMW Domains is the best approximation of a syndication hub for a distributed community we've yet to build, very much inspired by our earlier work with UMW Blogs and ds106.  One would think with the early syndication work with UMW Blogs we'd be able to crack the syndication nut. The fact we were locked into WordPress Multi-Site for everything with UMW Blogs, which on first thought should make things easier for this sort of thing, proved to be just the opposite. Everything was dependent on this one application (a similar issue we've always had with the LMS in edtech) which meant we'd become a bit myopic in our approach. With ds106 we started to understand community through a single WordPress install that simply acted as the syndication hub ? it was just the place we added the feeds. And while the the UMW Domains Community uses WordPress and FeedWordPress for the syndication, we are getting at the  While the UMW Domains Community site still uses WordPress and FeedWordPress for the syndication hub, with the web hosting and domain setup we've been able abstract out a level and start hooking into the application installer Installatron through API calls to enable us to add additional metadata when anyone installs an application. For example, when faculty and students install a WordPress site in their web hosting account they can assocaite it with a course, a specific instructor, topic, etc at the point of install. The results have been astounding, we now have a real community hub that not only features sites and recent work on the homepage, but also allows anyone to filter and search by instructor, department, course, semester, software, etc. All of which you can seen on the directory page of the UMW Domains Community site.  What's more, thanks to the add-on plugin FeedWordPress Advanced Filters all the content coming into the syndication hub can be filtered by predetermined categories we want to highlight. For example, 3D Printing, Digital History, the Internet, Storytelling, Gaming, etc. Radical!  To make the whole thing even more amazing, Martha just built a feature so that provides a calendar view of all the posts thus far. Each day shows a featured image and the number of published on a specific day of each month. Each day of this calendar based archive links to page with all the posts for that day.  With the UMW Domains Community site we're providing a much needed platform for our students and faculty to share what they're doing. What's more, it's an open space that anyone can explore. Hopefully, as a result, this will lead to serendipitous discoveries along the way to finding what we're looking for. This is exactly what Geocities offered in the mid 1990s that was radical. Geocities didn't only provide simplified web hosting, they also provided a sense of neighborhoods and communities so that people could get a broader view of what was happening. This was rarely, if ever, the case with commodity web hosting. All we're doing with the UMW Domains Community is taking the decade old reality of commodity web hosting and building an academic community around it. And that's just the begininng, we currently have a group of UMW Computer Science students designing a Reddit-inspired suite of plugins for upvoting, downvoting, discussion,a nd more ? but that's fodder for my next post ??  "Jim Groom,When User was Equal to Developer,http://bavatuesdays.com/when-user-was-equal-to-developer/,3/7/2014,"Olia Lialina pointed me to this amazing post she wrote back in 2010 about what she has coded the ""Prof. Dr."" style of webpages that can be dated back to 1993. In fact, the post is a tour-de-force of information about design in the early days of the web. She explains how she tries to convince her Interface Design students that the conception of site design is not reducible to Adobe's Creative Suite. Rather, she pushes them to examine the early site design of the mid 1990s web:  > ƒ.an era when the web was build and arranged and decorated by amateurs, when very web specific genres and looks were brought to existence, making it an incredible place to experience.  But even before the amateur free-for-all of the mid-90s there was the ""Prof. Dr."" webpages, and I absolutely love the way Olia frames this early genre of web design:  > ""Prof.Dr"" is a codeword, a tricky search request. I am aware of the fact that there are users outside of academia as well who always designed their sites in pure markup or redesigned according to 1993 standards recently. Still I suggest to use this name based on a scientific title as a tribute to the history, and reminder that all around the internet the very first pages were build at universities. To cement this term, within this article I'll use only pages of senior academics holding a doctoral title.  How brilliant, an homage to the ""Prof. Dr.""s who designed the web! But that's not all, oh no, that's not all:  > A ""~"" in the URL continues to be part of the look and reminds of early computer culture, when ""user"" was equal to ""developer"".(3) That's why, where it is possible, I prefer to use the examples with a tilde.  Disco, this is what I have been looking for to complete the circle with Domain of One's Own. The tilde was an indicator of a moment on the web when a user was equal to a developer! That's it, we can't turn back time, and I agree with Olia that this is not about a new retro aesthetic (although my impulse to make it that is very strong). This is about the recognition of a moment in time when a web space at a university was synonymous with developing the web. Helping to build it. In GeoCities terminology, homesteading. And that's what we are trying to do with Domain of One's Own, bring back a sense of web literacy in terms of design, history, and the possibilities to continue to particpate in it as an open, dare I say liberatory, space.  But Olia doesn't stop there, she is light years ahead of me. She goes on to theorize the power of the primitive nature of these ""Prof Dr."" pages.  > Primitivity tells us the story of the browser being not only a browser, but also an editor. Every user of the early web was a producer of web content. Web pages were to be opened in the browser to look at them, but also to edit them, using existing pages as templates for new pages. The simple design of HTML made it possible for the first users to create state of the art pages with only four to five principal tags. The result was an extremely fast growing web. There were not many options, this is why we got many pages.  And she goes onƒ  > Prof. Dr. pages look terribly the same. As if they were generated automatically by the browser, as one student said. Though, ironically, they are among the last pages generated completely by humans, not content management systems or services.  >  > They look according to the viewer's browser settings. This reveals the belief of the early 1990es that any visual design should be left at the discretion of the user.  A concept she later refers to as the ""End User = Designer."" A reality long gone, and as she notes ""it could only work for the very small web at connected universities.""  This is all gold, and there are innumerable examples of web pages from this era in her post. What's more, she then moves on to the vernacular web which she dates at roughly 1995 ? the moment the web exploded well beyond connected universities. I really appreciate this broader conceptual frame for the early web spaces at universities as a frame for the user as both developer and designer. And I don't necessarily take this to mean professional programmers and architects (even though the are Herr Doktors ?? ), as much as a community that is engaged and experimenting with form and connection through the tools that make it possible.  This brings us back, then, to a user innovation toolkit that enables and empowers people, which allows me to start making the link to the trailing edge of innovation that is the web. Olia surfaces so much of the design and conceptual thinking behind a web that returns us to some of its original magic as a web of links and people rather than third-party profiles and services. That said, I could easily fall into the dangerous trap of glorifying a moment wherein the potential of the read-write web was only available to the elite few. That's what has changed over the last two decades in terms of access to these robust toolkits for innovation that universities have patently ignored when the need for a depp, critical web literacy has never been greater.

The above title was something I tweeted out last night when I finsihed the presentation I delivered yesterday at the Digital Media Learning 2014 conference.  > Maybe title of 15 minute presentation tomorrow should be ""How did the Web become Ghettoized for Teaching & Learning in Higher Ed?"" #DML2014  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) March 6, 2014  I've been working on a broader narrative for contextualizing the work we're doing at University of Mary Washington with Domain of One's Own. This initiative offers students and faculty a domain and web hosting so that they can more deeply inhabit and interrogate the web. For some, it's most easily explained as an eportfolio, but for me that explanation is far too short- sighted. What's more, it ignores higher education's ongoing over-dependence on learning management systems (or siloed teaching and learning) for well over a decade.  Martha Burtis has been on a blog tear as of late framing our expeirence with Domain of One's Own six months on, how we are building out community through community.umwdomains.com, as well as how faculty and students are using UMW Domains. I recommend reading Martha's trifecta of awesome posts for a detailed account of where we are with Domains of One's Own to date.  In terms of the DML presentation, after briefly explaining Domain of One's Own and blowing the audience's collective mind ?? with the greatest Richard Scarry cannibalistic pig analogy ever used for explaining how domains/web hosting work based on this post (which accounts for the first 14 slides) I moved into the core of the presentation, at least for me, ""A Brief and Incomplete History of Personal Web Spaces"" starting at slide fifteen (see slide deck at bottom of post).  I've talked about tilde spaces (~/spaces) in relationship to Domain of One's Own in a cursory manner before, and the idea of tilde spaces as a precursor to UMW Domains is something I've continued to return to in my mind. In an attempt to more concretely frame the history of web publishing at universities I started doing some initial digging since. I hope to get deeper into this reseach in the coming months because it' a total blast, but until then, let me share out some initial discoveries.  Earlier this month, while talking about the history of personal web spaces on various campuses at the office, I sent out the following tweet to get a sense of the rough timing of whenpersonal web spaces started to show up at campuses around North America.  > Hey all you old gold edtech/web developers.

Paul Jones (@smalljones) February 10, 2014  While some of these personal web spaces were available as early as 1993, from this informal poll it seems that 1995 was the most common date for the collective memory on Twitter. And thanks to Tim Owens taking a spin on the Wayback Machine, we discovered the earliest recorded date for personal home pages at Mary Washington College (we didn't become a University until 2004) was Fall 1996. That's right, Domain of One's Own is hearkening back to a tradition almost twenty years old. There was even a ""community"" page offering an index of all the staff and student home pages. There's even a link for the howto.  Mary Washington College's personal homepage hub  A real pleasant surpise was that thanks to the awesomeness that is the Wayback Machine the links to these personal pages were archived. So we could see the various home pages of faculty and students linked to. And lo and behold Gardner Campbellïs personal home page was right there-front and center.  Gardner Campbell's 1996 Personal Homepage at MWC  The page links to his various courses for that semester, has an image of his kids as the header, and a whole series of relevant, scholarly and personal sources below. Hell, I was even able to listen to a recording of ""My Favorite Town"" (a song he wrote, produced, and perfomed) on his bio page. The genre of the personal home page was in full effect already in 1996.  > @jimgroom FWIW ""Genres and the Web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?"" https://t.co/JFcBZV38tP  ?  Alan Levine (@cogdog) February 10, 2014  And this genre was not limited to faculty, below is a screenshot of Molly Barber's home page from Fall 1996.  Molly Barber's homepage at MWC circa 1996  The following image is a scan of a tutorial (which I got from Andy Rush who started me down this rabbit hole) Jim Greenberg wrote about creating personal web pages at SUNY Oneonta. If you read it, you'll notice users had to create the www directory, change permissions, FTP files, write HTML, etc. In other words, creating and managing a personal webpage on universities servers back in the mid-90s wasn't simple.  But, at the same time, it was an option that was empowering. A larger number of schools from small liberal arts colleges to big universities provided their students and faculty with personal web space. This was on par with the cutting edge services of the time like GeoCities ? which also emerged in 1995. What GeoCities did well (and universities did not) was to use frontier and other spatial metaphors to link the folks exploring and writing on the web with ""homesteaders"" and pioneers that were building the virutal cities and neighborhoods of tomorrow. They featured their work and designed the entire site to promote community. To my knowledge, I don't know of any universities that tried this out with their personal web spaces. Does anyone out there have any examples of something like this?  Here is a my personal favorite webpage on GeoCities from 1996.  Another thing GeoCities figured out that universities didn't was how to make creating personal web pages as easy as possible. They created a GUI interface for uploading files, managing those files, and editing HTML ? not dissimilar from something like a streamlined CPanel.  As a result, by 1999 when it was sold to Yahoo! for $3.7 billion, GeoCities was the third most popular site on the internet behind AOL and Yahoo! The dot.com boom was in full effect, and GeoCities was a model of social space on the web. The rest is history, a decade later Yahoo! closed Geocities and effectively trashed a whole swath of internet history.  Thanks to the Archive Teamïs Herculean efforts, much of the GeoCities community was preserved and made available for free download a year after the shutdown. One terrabyte of data from the kilobyte age as Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied describe it as part of the cultural study/art project they're designed around the terrabyte dump of more than a decade of web culture. Their work is truly inspiring and as Dragan recently posted:  > The tumblr blog One Terabyte Of Kilobyte Age Photo Oppresents one way to make it all accessible, by transforming it into an exciting soap opera of screen shots.  >  > With the Geocities Research Institute's latest effort, categorizing the home pages can go as easily as checking tumblr: When accessed through the Geocities proxy server, each post is connected with the local database, widgets to view and modify the displayed home page's metadata are inserted into tumblr.  It's pretty awesome to think that after the corporate apocalypse that leveled GeoCities to internet kipple, a motley band of artists and archivists are picking up the pieces. Sadly, but not surprisingly, universities are nowhere to be found in this work ? we're too busy running conferences and doing digital humanities ??  On that note, while going through the Geocities FAQ from 1996 I stumbled upon this gem under the ""What is GeoCities all about section?"":  > We aspire to be positive contributors to this new culture. We're committed to developing innovative ways to foster the spirit of community that is so vital to the future success of the Internet and the World Wide Web.  And under the ""What is GeoCities hoping to accomplish?"" section I found this:  > Our homesteading initiative is just the first step in building World Wide Web based communities that are destined to become a vital part of the Net. Please send us an E-Mail if you're interested in learning more about helping build the societies of the New Frontier.  What?! This is from the GeoCities FAQ? The idealism of the web was at full rhetorical throttle. This doesn't sound like a business FAQ, this sounds likeƒlike magic. A vision of a web that I would like to believe universities, the guardians of culture, would have taken on the responsibility for fostering. Promoting a generative web by cultivating distributed communities of open publishing at the institutions that helped build and create the culture for the internet more generally.  But, instead we got thisƒ.  The blackbox for online publishing that was and is the learning management system (LMS). Like the pinetree deodorizers hanging from rearview mirrors, you could find one in every college and university. And as the world of Web 2.0 came around in the early 2000s the LMS became the rationale for dismissing blogs, wikis, and social media out of hand, while at the same time systematically discontinuing these personal web spaces provided on campuses without replacing them with anything else. The last relic of campus publishing spaces that tried, however pathetically at that late stage, to empower students and faculty alike were gone. So as we're waking up from the hangover of a decade of innvoation lost at the hands of the LMS we are greeted with the corporate MOOC. As Mike Caulfield notes so brilliantly, it's not Groundhog's Day it's Memento.  And where is the web in all this? Why are we surprised that we're still pulling teeth as instructional technologists to get faculty and students to recognize the value of the open web when it comes to teaching and learning? For more than a decade the web has been systematically ghettoized as a dangerous space where people steal and victims are robbed (not entirely false, but not the whole story either). It's during the Napster era that these educational safe spaces were introduced to ""protect"" our communities from the web, insulating us from what was possible at an astronomical cost. The fear and loathing surrounding the internet, copyright, and downloading that enabled universities during the late 90s to shutoff the web for anything beyond basic business operations is best summed up for me in the :38 second GI Joe PSA ""Stop All the Downloading.""  And that's basically the historical frame for the presentation as it relates to edtech. It's not perfect, and it's not done, but I will be presenting a few more iterations of this argument at least two or three more times over the next month. So any and all feedback is more than welcome.  I rushed through the final slides about how Domain of One's Own tries to revisit the idea of web publishing at unviersities that breaks beyond the lip service to social media and the inevitability of the LMS and/or MOOCs. It's time for universities to integrate the web into their culture across disciplines as a basic ingredient of literacy. But more on that anon, this post is way too long as it is, and I got to get some sleep. Here's the slides for the presentation if you're interested, and the video should be here at minute 34:00. That said, if you are short for time watch the presentation before mine by Jonathan Worth, as well as the one after by Kristen Swanson. They were much better than me ??  "Jim Groom,Devouring Videos,http://bavatuesdays.com/devouring-videos/,3/18/2014,"Last week was a blur, on top of catching up on my work from the Digital Media Learning conference the week before, I came back to interviews for a fine arts professor hire, trying to write an article (which I suck at), working with faculty, the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative, the Digital Scholars Institute, marvelling at the Domain of One's Own Community site, and a lot more. You know, all the other stuff I do when I should be blogging ??  What struck me is that on more than a few occasions I found myself watching some really compelling videos in the office, and I wanted to share a few before I forget about them. Turns out three of the five videos below was referred by Tim Owens , who, in turn, found them on the video curation site Devour. I have since subscribed. Good videos on the internet make me very happy.  Rear Window Timelapse  While working with Art History professor JeanAnn Dabb on her Hitchcock course she turned me on to Jeff Desomïs Rear Window Timelapse. It's a film within a film that's all about film, and the magic that must have been the set of Rear Window (1954). If you have three minutes and love movies, take the jump ? I promise you you'll be glad you did.  The DIY Engineer Who Built a Nuclear Reactor in His Basement   I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Doug Coulter is a rare character who mixes DIY culture with liberterian communism. But it's his open source pursuit of sinking a number of multi-Trillion dollar energy corporations by cracking the nuclear fusion nut in his trailer that strikes me as beautiful. He's quite the spokesmen of how open source could save the world ?? h/t Tim Owens  Monster Mash ? by I AM KAWEHI    Monster Mash ? by I AM KAWEHI from Kawehi on Vimeo.  Watching Kawehi take a simple audience request and turn it into ten minutes of a live looping set that is mesmerizing, brilliant, and she is just so cool about it all. I can't get enough of this one. h/t Tim Owens  Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis: President Barack Obama   This video was hysterical, this is the way to get the word out about Obamacare. Also, the use titles and lower thirds as a comedic presence got me thinking ? I love that stuff.  Shark Attack 3-13-2014    I can't go on a youtube binge without a near-death shark attack.

It's Jon's first year at UMW, but that didn't stop him from jumping into the Domain of One's Own fray with both feet. He's been experimenting with domains in the classes he teaches, and as well as a space to imagine various creative projects as part of his own work. He's even bringing the literary journal Font: Poetry he created for high school students in Chesapeake, Virginia into the virtual world as a part of his work with the Domain of One's Own faculty initiative.  So, when Jon and I sat down this afternoon to talk I imagined we would spend most of out time talking about these various projects, but in the end we didn't. We talked about his work. We talked about his memoir Sleep In Me ? which sounds devastatingly brilliant. We talked about skateboarding. We talked about Michelangelo as bad teacher. We talked about demystifying the process of writing. We talked about the wonder of memory. We talked about the power of open. In fact, we talked about a whole lotta things, and it was one of the most rewarding conversations I've yet to have as part of this series.  If you have 48 minutes, or even just four or five, take the time and listen to a truly engaging and compassionate storyteller frame the wonder he finds through the open doors of his imagination.  "Jim Groom,Tilde as Approximation,http://bavatuesdays.com/tilde-as-approximation/,3/25/2014,"> This symbol (in English) sometimes means ""approximately"", such as: ""~30 minutes ago"" meaning ""approximately 30 minutes ago"". It can mean ""similar to"", including ""of the same order of magnitude as"", such as: ""x ~ y"" meaning that x and y are of the same order of magnitude. Another approximation symbol is ?, meaning ""approximately equal to"" the critical difference being the subjective level of accuracy: ? indicates a value which can be considered functionally equivalent for a calculation within an acceptable degree of error, whereas ~ is usually used to indicate a larger, possibly significant, degree of error.  ? From the ""Common Use"" section of the Tilde Wikpedia article  On Saturday I gave a version of the ""Domains in the Afterglow"" talk that began taking shape after a panel presentation I was a part of at DML14. I'll be presenting it in full-featured form Friday (alliteration FTW) at Barcuh College. The Mary Washicon audience consisted of two people; I'm lucky it was the right two. Zach Whalen was kind enough to stay for my talk, as well as emoboiler Maureeen Iredell, who was crazy enough to invite me.  This run-through was really useful because after doing an abbreviated version Zach provided me some awesome feedback that I'll be building into Friday's talk. One recommendation was to explore the concept of afterglow a bit. To think of this concept not only as the Wikipedia definition of apocalyptic sunsets made possible by our pollution, or the trashheap of technological history as Bruce Sterling defines it in his presentation at Transmedial 2014, but rather as an illumination remaining where light has disappeared ? an aura akin to the glow of a CRT monitor after it's turned off. A dissipated energy that we can and should be reharnessing and re-directeding, a frame that will work nicely with my vision for Domain of One's Own towards the end of the presentation. This is not just another iPad giveaway or the next generation of churn and burn ware software, but a critical intervention in personal empowerment through the open web. What's more, such a vision shouldn't be limited to UMW ? that narrative is not only getting lonely, dangerously myopic.  All of which reminds me of something else Zach mentioned that resonated deeply with me, this presentation can and should be placed within a broader history of the web in higher education. Like Zach's talk on animated GIFs earlier that day, an attempt at an archaeologyÊ of the web that frames the work we're doing within a broader historical context is crucial. That said, I mut be clear that this presentation is an early, incompelte approximation of that at best. Nonetheless, I want this presentation to be the start of a focused resistance to the ahistorical impulse when talking about technology to suggest innovations, disruptions, and all the other buzzwords employed are actually deeply embedded signifiers within a complex network of social, economic, and cultural factors that have as much to do with the consolidation of power as they do with the liberation of networks.  But I digress, because what I really wanted to talk about when I started this post was this idea of exploring the tilde space I've been writing about recently through a technical, typographical, and representational lenses. Zach mentioned that the typographical character tilde ""~"" is not only a Unix command for denoting a user's home on the server, something like ~jgroom, the character also suggests an approximation. So, you can read ~jgroom as approximately Jim Groom. A space of approximation is fascianting to me because as we were talking about digital identity in the Internet Course last week the question of the traces one leaves online somehow approximate your presence, but can never truly represent the whole person. And you could easily say the same in the physical world. In fact, the ~ can move seamlessly between tehcnical, typographical, and representational readings, and it's a close reading a literal sign ? trippy.  So this notion of one's online presence as an approximation of who we are that has become increasingly fragmented (which is not a bad thing by any means) is part of a technical an tradition at universities that is as old as the web. This talk needs to position UMW Domains within this narrative as a critical intervention to start digging into the deeper representational implications of online identity as they relate to the academic discourse. For higher ed to reclaim a sense of the deeper philosophical, technical, and practical visions the web was born of, and the resultant implications on our transforming notions of identity (digital and otherwise) as it relates to the curriculum and community on our campuses more generally. Does that sound like for a plan, or what?    Ê I'm imagining this is referring directly to Michel Foucault ïs method he outlines in his book The Archaeology of Knowledge.  "Dave Henderson,What I learned from the Domain of One's Own program,http://www.profdavehenderson.com/uncategorized/what-i-learned-from-the-domain-of-ones-own-program/,3/26/2014,"I've really enjoyed the Domain of One's Own program. I've met new colleagues from other departments outside of the College of Business, I've learned about the importance of having a digital identity, and I've learned that website design has dramatically changed over the last ten years. I used to sling code for a large IT consulting firm in a former life before I became an academic. I actually wrote html in notepad! Since taking the Domain of One's Own classes, I've learned that coding a website has become much easier. If you want to change the background, menu, font of your website, just select a different theme. No need to go back into the html in notepad and make manual time- consuming updates. The hard part is designing my website hasn't been the html coding, like it used to be, the hard part is deciding how to present my digital identity. What do I want to show on my website? My research projects, publications, conference presentations? The courses I'm teaching and my teaching philosophy? My consulting interests? The hard part is deciding which content to present and how best to present it.  I've just about completed my domain (except for my consulting interests) and I really like it. I took me a while to find the right theme and to figure out the google doc embedder so that I could post my CV, teaching philosophy, and research summary. I think my final task will be to add my website to my email signature and to my bio on the UMW website.  "Jim Groom,Virtualization,http://bavatuesdays.com/virtualization/,3/28/2014,"Since I wrote a post last month about agile edtech, I've been thinking and talking with Tim Owens a fair amount about what a virtualized sandbox for DTLT (through something like Amazon Web Services) might look like. What would it mean for our group to have the ability to fire up a variety of server environments and corresponding applications (such as EdX's MOOC platform) in minutes? As Tim noted, this could be the next chapter of the BlueHost experiment UMW's DTLT embarked on a decade ago now.  I knew I'd read about these virtualized environments sometime last year on Brian Lamb's Abject blog, and after a bit of digging I found his ""The squirming facts exceed the squamous mind"" post in which he points to an approach, with prodding from Boris Mann, that might provide another way of thinking about deploying applications within educational environments.  A couple of days after Brian wrote that post, Stephen Downes OLDaily'd it, noting the following:  > The old hack stack is and was called LAMP ? Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl (or PHP). But these days servers are constructed in environments like Ruby on Rails or Django and services are often plug-in, hosted elsewhere and accessed via APIs, like MailChimp for mailing lists or Amazon Web Service for data hosting. Now LAMP itself is and was a viable alternative to large enterprise computing, the sort of environment you would set up for an institutional LMSƒ.for full-service startup sites class2go the new stack is great. For institution-strength LMSs supporting services like Desire2Learn's new Binder application, enterprise is the way to go. Just in the same way for groups and activities, Facebook and Twitter and other social networks give people what they need. But for personal computing, I think I'm still wanting my own server and my own applications, using but not depending on these online services.  Downes gets at the fact that depending on what you're trying to do your mileage may vary with each of these approaches. It's not all-in with either, though the LAMP stack becomes privilegedwhen it comes to ownership. That said, given UMW Domains provides a LAMP environment to anyone who wants to ""own"" their server and applications at UMW, that option is up and running. The next thing we'd like to explore is cloud-based server environments so that we can start experimenting with what's possible there.Tim has already done some of the early forays. What's more, we've been in discussion with both purchasing and IT about these possibilities and they've been really receptive. We're also hoping to get a rep from Amazon out to us sometime soon to demonstrate whats available in this space more broadly. One example is Amazon S3 storage for all Domain of One's Own users? Or maybe a the open source forum Discourse if folks want to play with that?  All this talk started me down a path of thinking about the next steps for OpenVA. We had our first call this week in a long while, and we're turning to the confernece this Fall. One of the ideas I threw out there was to frame it around the theme of ""Building an OpenVA."" What would it look like if the various colleges and universities around Virginia worked together to build a shared infrastructure with the possibilities of virtualized environments?  What am I talking about here? What if UMW, through a virtualized server environment, could seamlessly share various packages (or images) of our UMW Blogs environment or our Domain of One's Own environment to any other VA school to use? What if other schools did the same? What's more, could we begin to imagine a broader solution for shared hosting and adminstration as a consortium across schools so that we could truly start collaborating? It's still a pipe dream of mine to enable Virginia's colleges and universities to openly expose, through serendipitous juxtaposiiton, the broader life of the mind happening across the state of Virginia. If you think about what Domain of One's Own did for UMW when it came to syndicating distributed nodes into the Community site, what might that mean at the scale of the state? A full-blown open platform for ALL of Virginia's public higher education institutions. What's more, the open publishing element would be just one of the many heads wielded by this beautiful internet-powered hydra! It might be a fool's errand, but I've never not been a fool.  "Jim Groom,Teaching & Technology  in the Afterglow at Baruch College,http://bavatuesdays.com/teaching-technology-in-the-afterglow-at-baruch-college/,3/29/2014,"I want to share my impressions of Baruch's 17th Annual Teaching and Technology Conference before the sun sets on my memory and the experience dissipates in the afterglow of what was. I had a total blast doing it. I have deep personal ties and many a collaborator and friend at CUNY, so it's always a ball when they ask me to present. And I've been fortunate enough to have been invited more than a few times now. I just can't see how this pattern can be sustained much longer, especially after this talk ?? That said, I'm really honored Luke Waltzer and Baruch's CIO, Arthur Downing, invited me to do the keynote.  On a more logistical tip, I thought he format of this conference worked quite well. There were three time slots for general presentations from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, 10:35 AM to 11:35, and finally 11:40 to 12:40 PM. Each of these time slots had three or four concurrent sessions, all of which were full. After that, everyone met in a large conference hall for lunch and the all sorts of edtech wisdom (not necessarily in that order, mind you) from 12:45 to 2:00 PM.  GIF care of the great Micahel Branson Smith  In terms of the nature of the sessions, the three talks I went to were excellent. A rarity at any conference. I started the morning with a presentation by Monica Dean and Allison Lehr Samuels about Baruch's Pop-Up Makerspace. Although to start it wasn't a presnetation at all, there were two long tables and people sat down at a table filled with circuitry, duplo legos, fabric, and much more. Right off Michael Branson Smith, myself and two other attendees started making stuff. It was amazing how quick a half hour went by without any sense of a presentation, and when they did grab our attention it was to share out what we made and provide a quick frame for Baruch's Pop-Up Makerspace that we had all just experienced. Start with the demo, indeed. I loved their approach to the presentation, and I had a blast making a shanty house as well as collaborating on a DIY spinning night light that was a very rough prototype. There was also a 3D Printing working tirelessly in the background as we were playing around.  I spent a bit of time at the beginning of the second time slot for sessions getting the AV and streaming requirments for my presentation worked out. I'd like to take a quick moment to note that the technical support on the ground at Baruch making sure everything went seamlessly was the best I've ever worked with in the eight years I've be doing the conference rodeo. The were professionals through and through, and that makes all the difference. They recorded the talk and there should be an archived video of the keynote at some point soon. I have no doubt it will be excellent. Anyway, after that I caught the last half of the ""Publishing with Blogs@Baruch"" session featuring two students, Albert Mathew and Arvien Siswanto, who gave a brilliant talk about the blogging they do for the Weissman Center for International Business. I was really struck with what poised, yet passionate, presenters they were, it was quite the showing. Following them, the chair of Baruch's Jounralism department, Josh Mills, discussed the award winning magazine on Blogs @Baruch Dollars and Sense. This magazine published students' local reportage on topics such as homelessness, Hurricane Sandy, Food Stamp cuts, etc.  The session struck me how much I've taken for granted how much amazing work is happening on Blogs@Baruch as a matter of course. The power of blogging never did go mainstream in highered, but the few of us who've pushed it to the limit have created some bonafide magic. Between the pop-up makerspace, state of the art publishing platforms, and the video assessment tool Vocat ( a presentation I didn't attend), the work folks like Luke Waltzer, Tom Harbison, Suzanne Epstein, and Mikhail Gershovich have done over the last ten years has truly had a deep impact on the teaching and learning culture of Baruch. This conference was testament of that for me, and I'm sure for them too.  The final presentation I attended shared out of research collected by librarians Maura Smale of City Tech and Marianna Regalado of Brooklyn College about how students from at least five different CUNY colleges are using technology as part of their educational experience. They started with the quantitative demographic information which was fascinating. But it really became poetry when they started sharing the stories collected from the students. They did qualitative research that featured interviews, student drawn maps of their commutes (a huge part of anyone's life in NYC), images of their favorite study spots, schematics of their technology, etc. They called this bit CUNY Tech Stories, and the way it dug deep into the aprticulars of the CUNY student, their particular challenges, and alos their unbelievable richness of experience. it was a surefire reminder of why CUNY is such a special place, despite all the bureacratic frsutrations that come with a system that big. They'll be publishing this work, and I really can't wait until they do, it's deeply resonant and important. My only recommendation would be to do much more of it ??  Also, Luke Waltzer and Kate O'Donoghue presented their own findings of a survey they conducted about student preceptiosn of online learning at Baruch College which was very telling. I'd write about it here, but I'm not going to because Luke needs to freaking blog in his new role. As soon as CUNY makes him a director he's already complaining about time, writing, etc. And he didn't blog nearly enough already. Three words: deal with it. Two more: just blog. There are no excuses if you're gonna preach open, you need to lead the way and set the example. Share these awesome stories regualrly, promote your faculty and students, carve out the time ? it's the most important work we do. Have you learned nothing from the bava, you Michigan hippie?! I kid because I love, but also because his voice is way too important to remain quiet.  Finally, the keynote. It was a bit meandering and indulgent, I'll admit that upfront. This was the third version in as many weeks of the ""Domains in the Afterglow"" talk I've been working on. It started in its curren concept at the Digital Media Learnign Conference and was further tweaked for Mary Washicon. I say indulgent and meandering ebcause I spent an inordinate amount of time on the early web space stuff, tilde spaces, Geocities and the cultural history because I am so drawn to it right now. I should have gotten to UMW Domains sooner. Truth be told, I could've cut the history section down by half. That said, I warned Luke I might be a bit indulgent, and I was using the opportunity to try and get a rhythm around it.  Also, I think I need to shorten and change-up the Domains/house/Richard Scarry analogy. While I love it, Michael Branson Smith gave me a better approach, and I'm going to run with it. I'll be presenting this talk again for the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference in Dallas in less than ten days, and again at the end of the month in Atlanta for Emory University's Domain Incubator. I'm having fun with thus far, and I'm hoping to have it nailed for Atlanta because I'm putting this one to bed after that.  In terms of the presentation for me, it was liberating not to talk UMW Blogs or ds106. It's been years since they weren't the foundation of some part of my talk. I've really been enjoying the move back into a bit of independent research of edtech more broadly spurred on by Domain of One's Own. Alos playing around with popular concpetions of the web and teaching and technology with the GI Joe PSAs created by Fensler Films. A sign of a good project is it keeps you moving and searching, UMW Domains has certainly done that for me. Also, the push to blog my thinking has helped me incorporate invaluable feedback from folks like Chris Lott, Scott Leslie, Alan Levine, and Mike Caulfield into the talk. Actively writing about my thinking for this talk has been useful for challenging some of my assumtpions, and keeping me honest. What's more, I've been inspired by Brian Lamb's thinking and writing on this subject lately. I especially love it when he talks the learning objects repository history. This is one of the earliest lessons I got when orientating myself in the broader discourse of the field in 2006/2007. What's more, it's affirming for me that I want to do more work in this vein. The return to a bit more focused reading and writing has been doing my imagination and inspiration good, so why not feed it? As Brian noted: ""Somebody should do a dissertation on the values embedded in guides like these.""  Before I throw the slides at you. While the presentation still needs work, I want to thank the CUNY folks in the audience for putting forth an encouraging front even if they it was tiresome. In fact, the Question and Answer portion of this talk was extraordinary. I'm not sure how long it went on for, but it seemed to be as long as, if not longer. than the talk itself. And I am not ashamed to admit much better. The questions were great and I felt like on some level I'd connected with at least a few people. That's what I'm doing this for in the end, and I really do want to believe some of the ideas I'm sharing frame an ethos of liberating our imagiantion of edtech from rigid, soul sucking systems. Alternatively, the open web as platform for teaching and learning. For me Baruch is a shining example that communities of people can make a real dent in institutional culture.  I'll end on a personal bavalove note. I really missed hanging with Mikhail Gershovich while up in NYC this go around. He's my Russian connection, and I sorely missed him yesterday. That said, it was awesome to see so much of the great work he helped set in motion continue to gain momentum!  "Jim Groom,Reclaim the Handout,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-the-handout/,3/30/2014,"Click image to download PDF  Ryan Brazell shared the prep work he did last week framing UMW's various digital projects for the AAC&U Diversity, Learning, and Student Success conference in Chicago. Just yesterday he presented alongside Tim Owens and Mary Kayler on UMW Domains, the Online Learning Initaitive, and, based on the document below, at least a nod to the nascent Digital Scholars Instititue. If the document Ryan created as a resource for attendees is any indicator, it looks to have been an amazing session.  I really appreciate the way the handout balances the history and vision of DTLT's work in the ""Bags of Gold"" section and then goes on to outline the convergence of the various digital initiatives happening at UMW. All of which is topped off with nuts and bolts resources for getting up and running with your own domain as well as a sidebar ""Reclaim Toolkit."" I've been blogging about much of this work for over eight years now, and I've never been able to clarify and synthesize it all so cleanly. It's such a great document because it captures the spirit of all the digital happenings at UMW so succinctly.  DTLT will be presenting Domain of One's Own to the Board of Visitors in ten days time, and I think this would be an awesome addition to that presentation as a takeaway. In fact, I'm thinking about re-working this document a bit and printing a couple of hundred to distribute at both my ""Reclaim Your Domain"" workshop as well as the keynote presentation at Sloan-C talk in Dallas, Texas. Moreover, this would make an awesome addition to DTLT's website given how crisply it tells our story. It would make a great pointer for the ""bio page,"" so to speak, for our group. It perfectly frames who we are, what we do, and why we do it. Brilliant stuff. All that said, I still didn't find the supposed Easter Egg ? I think he's bluffing ??  "Jim Groom,Domains in (Stop) Motion,http://bavatuesdays.com/domains-in-stop-motion/,3/31/2014,"On Friday Martha Burtis made an amazing bit of stop-motion animation for the Domain of One's Own project. It was designed for the EagleVision digital signage we have up around campus as a way to promote the project ? explaining the absence of sound. I really love the idea of lowfi whiteboard animation art to showcase UMW Domains, it hearkens back to the old gold ""Funny Faces"" animation done by Stuart Blackton in 1906. Martha has nailed it, and I'm going to spend part of this week imagining another approach for using EagleVision to communicate this project to the campus community. It's actually a cool, relevant, and localized challenge to tackle, and I'm excited to get back in creative mode for at least a bit. Thanks or the inspiration Burtis!  "Jim Groom,Re-routing Cyberinfrastructures,http://bavatuesdays.com/re-routing-cyberinfrastructures/,3/31/2014,"Mike Caulfield has a really interesting post on the future of personal cyperinfrastructures. The crux of the argument is while Domain of One's Own is right, true and beautiful, no one really wants to manage their own bit of a server through a cPanel-driven web hosting environment. In fact, life is already far too cold, brutish, and short to add sysadmin to the mix ??  His idea, instead, is that folks should have a virtualized server stack that they install apps on that they buy, but at the point of sale you own the app and its data which are both kept on your own server (which is encrypted so your virtual host can't read). In other words, you own your data and your apps in a highly customizable, portable, and secure virtualized server environment, but you don't have to worry about the sysadmin headache.  I really like his vision as a broader cultural model to move towards, and I think it's a pretty smart frame for what's to come. But as Ryan Brazell notes in his comment on that post, it's not exactly in the spirit of Domain of One's Own as we've imagined it. We are far more interested in a curricular intervention. We actually want some of this stuff to be visible and remain challenging, we want students to struggle a bit with this environment, and we want faculty to consider the roots of the web. That said, I'm not suggesting folks need to suffer to learn. This isn't the Christian vision of sacrifice for salvation. An investment in understanding conceptually and technically how the web works through the cPanel interface provides a curricular and technological platform for just that.  What's more, at this point more than 600 people at UMW have have signed up for a domain and used CPanel to create subdomains, installed their own application, and more. That's something ? it tells me that while we keeping saying this stuff is hard and we need it to be easier when, in fact, it's (a) not all that hard and (b) a worthy concept space to struggle with regardless. But I agree with Mike that the struggle need not be for everyone all the time. UMW Domains might benefit from more seamless options for creating a subdomain or installing a new blog. Tim Owens has been talking about such a setup for a while using APIs in a WordPress dashboard ? I'm totally onboard. There are times when the CPanel might not be necessary, but it's presence as a tool for folks to explore and figure out remains essential to the project.  I wrote a post the other day that UMW is exploring virtualized server environments, so Mike's argument speaks to me on this front. But I guess I tend to see reasons and possibilities for both the old gold LAMP environment with the CPanel GUI interface as well as the ability to fire up servers, experiment with apps, etc. I can even see us giving each student a virtualized environment down the road as well so they can map subdomains on various tools they are using in the virtualized environment. Why limit them to one space? Why limit freedom?  I both love Mike's idea and I share Ryan's concerns. Making something like Domain of One's Own too plug-and-play defeats the purpose, at the same time making it too hard is not a solution either. Making it part of the discourse on campus around what the web is and how we need to think about it more broadly for our teaching is exactly what we want to communicate!  "David Raths,An E-Portfolio With No Limits,https://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/02/an-e-portfolio-with-no-limits.aspx,4/2/2014,"Students at the University of Mary Washington build their academic identities on their own personal Web domain. As many universities look to certifications, badges and e-portfolios as vehicles to allow students to demonstrate their achievements and skills, another movement has begun to surface on campus: a personal web domain for each student. At the University of Mary Washington (Fredericksburg, VA), this academic year has seen the evolution of a blogging platform used by faculty and staff into a Web-hosting space where students can use an array of tools to build their own academic identities, with no limits. And the idea is catching on: Since UMW started its project, Davidson College (NC) has received a Mellon Grant to work on digital curriculum, including individual student domains, and Emory University (GA) is piloting the student domain concept in a writing program. A Domain of One's Own The UMW project, called ""A Domain of One's Own,"" actually grew out of efforts of a campus group researching e-portfolios. ""We found that the term e-portfolio means many different things to different people, depending on which needs you want to address,"" said Martha Burtis,special projects coordinator in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT). ""Out of that conversation, we asked what we could do now with the university blogging platform to take it one step further for students."" As its introductory Web page explains, A Domain of One's Own ""allows students, faculty and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a space on a UMW-managed Web server. In that Web space, users will have the opportunity and flexibility to design and create spaces of almost unlimited possibilities. Within the system, they may install LAMP-compatible Web applications, set up subdomains and e-mail addresses, and install databases. In addition, users may choose to 'map' their domain (or a subdomain) to other services, such as ... UMW Blogs, Google Sites, or Tumblr."" The Web site's intro sales pitch to students says, ""Build out your own space on the Web to define who you are instead of having a service do it for you,"" and ""Gather the artifacts of your digital identity in a central place that you own and control."" A pilot project was conducted in 2012-2013 with 400 students and faculty. After the pilot, the university decided to expand the program by making it available to each freshman class, starting with the incoming freshmen in the fall of 2013. But as Tim Owens, instructional technology specialist, noted, DTLT staff found that although they had an engagement strategy in place, they had difficulty getting freshmen to sign up. Early usage statistics showed more activity by seniors and juniors, some of which was rollover from the pilot; others were enrolled in classes in which professors were creating domains tied to their curriculum. ""As freshmen, they have a thousand things going on when they first get here, so creating their own domain on the Web is low on that list,"" Owens said. ""Although we got some to sign up, we realized our strength was in working with faculty on integrating it as part of a course. That will inform the way we move forward. We are opening it up to anyone on the campus who wants his or her own domain. If half of the students did it, that would be 2,000."" (UMW currently has 590 domains.) Many students are using their domains to demonstrate their academic work. For instance, student Suzanna Toske uses her domain Toske Ink to display a portfolio of her work with geographical information systems. Candice Roland, a history major, uses her domain to detail her work in historical preservation. (The data is portable, and students have the opportunity within six months of graduation to port it to any domain-hosting site they choose.) Burtis and Owens say 30 faculty members have their own domains, many as part of courses in which they work with their students on digital projects. These domains are less about student identity, but they do allow students to do some sophisticated group projects. ""One of the key things is allowing students to explore a lot of possibilities,"" Burtis said. In a geography class, for example, students might be tasked with creating digital presentations and interactive maps. ""They can build representations of their research that are much more powerful than a written paper."" Students have access to tools such as Omeka, an open source content management system for digital humanities. ""We can provide access to that in a way we couldn't provide easily in the past,"" she added. Making History Susan Fernsebner, an associate professor of history, created a domain for the first semester of a two-semester history methods seminar. In the second semester, each student will have his or her own domain. In this class, they created a domain around the Taiping Civil War in China. ""I wanted to have a project that would let them work cooperatively,"" Fernsebner explained. ""I decided a Web site project would work."" She had them look at other digital sites about the topic, including Wikipedia, and then asked them to design their own. ""Rather than just writing papers for me, they are creating something for a public audience,"" she said. ""I have shared it with an American Historical Association conference and an Association of Asian Studies meeting. The students are using it as an example of their work as they apply for internships."" This site provides an introduction to the Taiping Civil War (1850-1864). Students compiled three resources for students of the conflict: An annotated bibliography and interview with Dr. Tobie Meyer-Fong, author of What Remains: Coming to Terms with Civil War in 19th Century China (Stanford UP, 2013) A timeline of major events and related primary source texts from the conflict. A map of sites as well as related primary source texts from the conflict. Fernsebner said DTLT's Ryan Brazell was instrumental in helping the students with the mapping and timeline projects. Students learned how to integrate the primary sources with the technology and visual presentation tools. Often Fernsebner and the students were on the same learning curve. ""I am pretty comfortable with digital technology, but some of the applications are new to me,"" she said. ""And sometimes I wasn't present when the students received the training, so they ended up teaching me, and that was an empowering moment for them. They developed some real confidence."" A Cultural Shift Owens said the Domain of One's Own project has presented some challenges for DTLT: ""It has been a change in the way we do our job. We are shifting to saying yes when faculty or students are interested in trying something new. The sky is the limit for them, but at the same time they and we have to realize we are limited in our expertise in using many tools."" Burtis agreed. ""We have a whole different perspective on support now. We have a bounded set of things we can do as a department,"" she said. ""We can give you the world, but the approach has to be agile and helping users find answers for themselves. It is a cultural shift, a multiyear one."" There were fewer concerns about students publishing inappropriate comments or content, she said. ""We have a track record of open publishing on the Web, so we have learned what to expect, and we don't have a lot of issues with inappropriate content, because this is linked to students' academic identity. We do some education about the practicalities of copyright issues."" In a recent blog post, Burtis called A Domain of One's Own the most complex project she's ever worked on ""in terms of the moving parts of technology, the complexity of support, and the need to help users conceptualize the space in very deep (and often challenging) ways. I have no doubt that as A Domain of One's Own grows and matures, our understanding of it will continue to evolve. We are, in effect, creating a platform for deep cultural transformation at the university. Such transformation is not easy or neat, and we must remain mindful of this."" Another recent development has been the creation of a community site that aggregates the activity of the project, including sites created and content published. ""We are just getting started on that process of sharing across disciplines and cross-pollinating ideas,"" Owens said. In addition, Fernsebner is working with a digital scholars institute on campus, which holds regular meetings to share ideas across disciplines. Burtis believes student, faculty and class domains open up a window to the intellectual life of the university. ""Universities spend a lot of time thinking about how to make connections and promote their work through their Web presence. Some schools have a large marketing department,"" she noted. ""But through these sites we are exposing the life of the mind of the university in real time on the open Web, and using the Web in the way it was originally designed for."" Pilots on Other Campuses This year, 30 English classes are participating in the pilot Domain of One's Own at Emory University. Its Web site notes that the program offers students ""a unique opportunity to register their own personal Web domain as a digital portfolio of especially innovative coursework. Participating classes will be at all levels from first-year composition to graduate school."" Among the initiatives in the expansion of digital studies at Davidson College is ""Davidson Domains,"" which will provide every Davidson student a unique domain name and access to an open source platform such as WordPress. The program will begin in 2014 as a pilot using several sections of the required first-year writing course, with first-year students in 2015-2016 as the first full participants. "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own: as Limitless as the Web,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-as-limitless-as-the-web/,4/3/2014,"UMW's Domain of One's Own is the focus of David Raths's recent article ""An E-Portfolio With No Limits"" in Campus Technology. I have to immediately note how impressed I was with his reporting. Raths did his research; reached out to several different folks; linked to the various sites he was writing about; and generally spent the time and energy to fully understand a fairly complex teaching and learning ecosystem. What I like about the eportfolio lens is that it catches the attention of a broad base of readers who have struggled with rigid, vendor-driven options for providing such a service on their campuses. UMW Domains provides a new take on that formula that enables institutions to empower faculty, staff, and students alike to manage their work over the course of their career and beyond. By premising eportfolios on domain and commodity web hosting we can move the conversation to the roots of the open web ? which is the only thing that scales beautifully, is eminently portable, and vendor agnostic.  The other thing I love about the eportfolio frame (something Mike Caulfield picked up on during a conversation we had back in the Fall) is that it acts like a Trojan Horse for a host of far more powerful possibilities. Once the eportfolio gets you in the door, we can introduce a host of underlying literacies that accompany managing your own space on the web. For example: how domains and web hosting works; what a subdomain is; how to install a host of open source applications; how databases store information; how Google finds your online presence; how you can export and port your data, etc. In other words, a portal (to reclaim a loaded edtech term) to a broader frame for digital literacy as part of the curriculum. More than a portfolio, UMW Domains provides a robust platform that people can experiment with ?  a ""user innovation toolkit"" to quote Jon Udell. A space to return some of the immense potentiality of technology back to the community at large. This is truly where the idea of ""no limits"" comes in, the portfolio is just the gateway drug to the personal cyberinfrastructure which is as limitless as the web. Enjoy the article, I did. UMW Domains, the future is here and now!  "Jim Groom,Humans in the Afterglow,http://bavatuesdays.com/humans-in-the-afterglow/,4/8/2014,"Almost two weeks ago I presented at Baruch College about the history of the web in edtech. I focus in particular on web publishing in higher ed, and I explore the early tilde spaces for HTML authoring as well as Geocities, the mid-90s solution for websites made easy. The presentation is called ""Domains in the Afterglow Or, What We Can Learn from Geocities about Digital Identity,"" I got a ton of great feedback from the CUNY folks who attended that talk. I'll be fine-tuning that presentation tonight for my keynote address tomorrow at the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference here in Dallas, Texas.  One of the gems I came away with as a result of the Baruch conference came electronically almost a week later. Courtney Walsh, Reference & Instruction Librarian at Brooklyn College, emailed me about a remarkable connection she made between my talk and one of the many stories shared on Brandon Stanton's brilliant storytelling site Humans of New York:  > ƒduring your talk, when you started talking about Geocities, I flashed on a memory of a somewhat recent HONY postƒso I googled HONY Geocities and found this amazing post from August 10, 2013.  The post Courtney is referring to follows in its entirety:  > I made my first website with a friend when I was in 7th grade. It was called Gaming Galaxy Online. It was extremely cheesy ?  with a giant animated GIF as the title graphic, and pretty much all content harvested straight from other sources. The page never got any traffic, but I remember how exciting it was to build the site. The internet seemed like a place where a 7th grader could participate in the adult world on a level playing field. My friend and I tried one website idea after another. None of them really worked, but we felt very empowered. On the internet, it felt like we were one good idea away from a very adultlike level of success. And like pretty much everyone else in 1996, our free websites were hosted on Geocities.com.  >  > Fast forward almost 20 years ? - in my late twenties, after countless attempts, I've finally managed to create a popular website. And last night I was out gathering content. I was walking past the Apple Store on 59th and 5th when I spotted a man sitting alone in the plaza. I asked for his photo, he agreed. ""What was the happiest moment of your life?"" I asked him.  >  > ""Probably when my company had its IPO,"" he answered. ""I founded a company called Geocities.com.""  So crazy! Stanton meets and photographs ,who I am assuming is, David Bohnett by happenstance on the streets of NYC. As a result a time-space portal in the internet opens up! The promise of Geocities was not necessarily the IPO (arguably that killed it) or that Bohnett somehow ""made"" Stanton the storyteller he is today. Rather, as Courtney notes so eloquently, is that the platform got ""kids creating web sites, dreaming, afterglow, Geocities, happiness, you name it!"" Geocities was a space Brandon felt an ""adultlike level of success"" was possible. A place where the playing field was leveled, and he was both excited and empowered. That's what Domain of One's Own can and should be!  I don't think any of those emotions are afterglow. Rather, that's the soul of the web. It lives on well after all the abandoned sites and dead links have gone dark. That's the magic of this story, it's not about Geocities per se, but about the wonderment embodied within the immense potentiality at the heart of the internet that Geocities actuated. How is higher ed doing this?  I can't thank Courtney enough for taking the time to share this with me. It's going into my talk tomorrow, and I have a feeling it is just the frame I needed to connect a whole series of ideas. And all credit will go to you!  "Jim Groom,"Egypt Calling or, Why Open Rules",http://bavatuesdays.com/egypt-calling-or-why-open-rules/,4/9/2014,"I had been procrastinating a bit on the ""Reclaim Your Domain"" workshop I'll be running in just about an hour's time at the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference. This is the first time I've workshopped what we're doing at UMW with Domain of One's Own, and thanks to the service Tim Owens and I started, appropriately named Reclaim Hosting, it's been pretty cool. I already talked about the setup of the workshop here.  You see the workshop will also include virtual participants, In fact, there will be folks joining in as far away as Egypt as I learned on Twitter.  > @jimgroom looking forward to your two talks on #et4online which i will be attending virtually ?? here from Egypt   ?  Maha Bali (@BaliMaha) March 31, 2014  So I wanted to be sure I had documentation and a platform that would enable the virtual folks to particpate seamlessly.  > @BaliMaha Excellent, if you're doing Reclaim Your Domain workshop virtually, i think it would work well. Let me know and we can pre-plan!   ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) March 31, 2014  As a result I learned how awesome Maha Bali is (I was originally referring to her as Bali because of her domain, I suck). Two days ago Tim and I got the reclaimdemo.com site up and running (admittedly later than promised) and thanks to Maha, who was kind enough to offer testing rom afar, I think it might actually work.  But more than testing out the site, and test it out she did, she also wrote a post on her sandbox domain at bali.reclaimdemo.com calling out some key questions I need to address more broadly as part of the Reclaim push:  > I feel there is an assumption here that people taking this workshop already buy into the idea of ""owning"" or ""reclaiming"" one's own domain. I am not clear on all the arguments for that yet (need to read and discuss some more) but I definitely do feel like my online presence is distributed and I would like to have it all in one place under my control. I just don't know if that will complicate my life more than I need  This is the real question I need to get at whether or not the platofrm works. I assume folks see the value, and I forget that I have to try and make this whole thing relevant to someone who isn't necessarily an edtech fanatic like me. I need to step back a bit and start thinking about what a domain and web hosting has offered me on personal, professional and practical levels as an educator, edtech, father, and more generally a person online in the 21st century.  This was truly invaluable feedback, but I am not surpised because Maha seems ot be a truly cool person who embodies the spirit of open collaboration and is a welcome reminder that these networks lead us to real people. This is what happens when you openly and actively engage people online. Openness is like the force in Star Wars: ""a river from which many can drink."" But Maha says all this much better on her blog, which may even be hosted on her own domaina nd web hosting with a shiny new domain sometime soon ??  "Jim Groom,Trojan Horses in the Afterglow at Sloan-C,http://bavatuesdays.com/trojan-horses-in-the-afterglow-at-sloan-c/,4/11/2014,"Detail from ""The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy"" by Domenico Tiepolo (1773), inspired by Virgil's Aeneid  I had a pretty intense day at the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference on Thursday. (It actually took me two days to recover mentally). I presented a workshop first thing in the morning on how to ""Reclaim Your Domain."" There were about 15-20 folks in the room for that, and I am guessing roughly the same number online. I had a really fun time with this session because it was a pretty focused overview of how web hosting works. Particpants created their own subdomains on reclaimdemo.com, and from there we all navigated cPanel, created subdomains, installed applications with Installatron, and explored File Manager. We covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time, and it further reinforced people can get up running with their own web hosting in very little time. What's more, there was some great discussion along the way. This was a thoroughly enoyable session for me, and it hits close to home because this is how I got started in edtech over ten year ago thanks to Zach Davis.  After the workshop I went back to my room and fine-tuned my keynote presentation before taking part in a carreer forum organized by Rolin Moe about what it means to be an ""EdTech Practitioner."" I was joined by Michael Berman and Chris Mattia of CSU Channel Islands, two of the many great folks I had the pleasure of meeting at this conference (I'll be writing a separate post to list all of them!). It was a full room, and I'm afraid I might have ruffled some feathers while admonishing folks to stay away from edtech degrees. There were two bits of advice that Michael Berman gave that I thought were spot on:    1. if you are working in edtech and haven't taught at the college level, you should fix that;   2. if you're looking for a job in edtech don't wait to be hired, start doing edtech ? the web is your oyster.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd, Words. Of. Wisdom.  After that session I presented about the work happening at UMW with Domains of One's Own in a very big room. The presentation was a further exploration of the ""Domains in the Afterglow"" talk I did at Baruch two weeks ago. It was tighter than the Baruch talk, and I integrated a five-slide skreed against the learning management system I lifted directly from Brian Lamb's brilliant writing on the topic in an article we'll be publishing in EDUCAUSE Reviewïs next issue. I also worked in a cartoon and two concepts from Tim Klapdor's brilliant post on ""Literacy and the Digital Self"":     ""digital literacy"" is a poorly defined concept and there's a significant gap between the idea and the reality;    How do we create a ""student-centric technology ecosystem""?  These worked as beautiful transitions to the work we are doing with Domain of One's Own at UMW, so special thanks to Tim and Brian for making my presentation tighter.  In terms of the approach I took with this presentation, in hinsight I realized it worked a bit like a trojan horse on two counts. First, by starting off talking about the afterglow of 1990s personal web publishing through the lens of Geocities and tilde spaces on university servers that most folks in the room could relate. In fact, I'm sure they appreciated a bit of light-hearted nostalgia and history-based superiority while taking in the seemingly simple, rather rudimentary design sensibility of the early web. That bit helped them open up their hearts and minds to the ideas immediatly before I dropped the bomb. I moved from Geocities and tilde space to an aggressive dismantling of our field's addiction to the learning management systems to solve all of our technology-based teaching and learning problems.  The second trojan horse was openly named as such when I suggested approaching Domain of One's Own as an eportfolio at one's institution to get it in the door. This is something I've talked about a bit already, but I think it bears repeating. If the idea that something like UMW Domains is an eportfolio solution gets your foot in the door, run with it. Not only because it can defintiely be that, but because that's just the beginning. The secret is that it's pretty easy to demonstrate how much more than ""just a tool"" web hosting is; it quickly becomes a user innovation toolkit! So, I am fine with folks calling it an eportfolio solution if they undestand that's just the gateway pitch to get the Greeks in the door ??  As I realized soon after my talk, the back channel discussion on Twitter was raging. More than a few folks were resistant to my critique of the LMS, and I appreciate that. My talk comes from many of my biases and freedoms as a result of the work I am doing at UMW, and I welcome more discussion around what's possible, or not, with the LMS and why. The thing that kills me is there seems to have been a general, tacit agreement in this field that the LMS is THE one system we all need for teaching and learning. And I don't' necessarily agree. In fact, I think it's just that mindset that has stifled this field when it comes to broader innovations with networked learning.  [<a href=""//storify.com/SloanConsortium/et4online-keynote-jim-groom-on- reclaiming-learnin"" target=""blank"">View the story ""#et4online Keynote: Jim Groom on Reclaiming Learning"" on Storify</a>]  Anyway, that's the skinny on #et4online. I had a great time, and it was kinda fun to get back to a really big edtech conference like this. The faces of relatively new vendors to the field like Bluehost's Spoke and CampusPress made me feel a bit old (more on this in another post), but also suggests this space is moving in some interesting directions we've all been pushing on for a long while. Having someone host and manage some of the infrastruture in that regard is fine, but the complex design for teaching and learning on the web remains something we all must grapple with as an existential condition, not a product that can solve everything.  Below is a video of the talk, forgive my constant movement but I have to admit I was a bit nervous for this one.  "Jim Groom,Considering Running Domain of One's Own on Your Campus?,http://bavatuesdays.com/considering-running-domain-of-ones-own-on-your-campus/,4/15/2014,"Well then, Martha Burtis, Tim Owens, and Ryan Brazell have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Below are a series of resources that we have shared with people who are inquiring about running UMW Domains on their own campus. The response from folks at the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference about the possibilities of Domain of One's Own has been really encouraging, and I think we're both excited and relieved to find out not everyone thinks we're crazy ??  So, feeding off some of that excitement, I figured I would annotate a series of links to the various posts and documents about DoOO over the last two years that Martha Burtis sent me earlier this afternoon. Additionally, I am including an updated version of Ryan Brazell's handout which provides an awesome overview of the broader trajectory of digital projects at UMW.  ## Domain of One's Own: The Pilot  As Martha noted in the email she sent earlier:  > Here is the original 5-part series Tim wrote about the pilot setup. The caveat to these is that some of this has changed since the project went live this fall (we're not using Plesk, we have a different sign-up procedure, etc).  Building a Domain of One's Own, Part 1  The first post is a 30,000 feet overview of our vision for bringing web hosting on campus. Getting a virtual private server, connecting with ENOM (the domain wholesaler), and taking stock of where we were six months into the pilot. It's a broad look at what the hell we were getting into, as well as considering where we might go in terms of software, services, etc. http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/01/building-a-domain-of-ones-own-hosting/  Building a Domain of One's Own, Part 2  The second post is an examination of the actual space where users manage their own slice of the server: the control panel. In short, the graphic interface that allows you to manage your bit of the server without using command line and drinking Mountain Dew. Some confusion with terminology here might be that during the pilot we used Plesk (one brand of control panel software), but ultimately decided on cPanel (the industry standard brand) for the official launch. Tim is weighing the possibilities of both, but this post gives you a nice, detailed look at just what it is your community members can do with their own slice of hosting heaven ?? http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/01/building-a-domain-of-ones-own-the-panel/  Building a Domain of One's Own, Part 3  In part three of this series, Tim does an excellent job taking you through the thinking around how to handle sign-ups for the domain and web hosting service on campus. There are more than a few moving parts, so this post really takes you through the thinking for the pilot which we changed quite a bit for the offical launch in August. http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/01/building-a- domain-of-ones-own-the-sign-up/  Building a Domain of One's Own, Part 4  The fourth post finds Tim framing out our hosting environment, effectively bringing together all the various software pieces on the server level. One of the best choices we (royal WE) made was going with Installatron over Simple Scripts or Fantastico. Also, WHMCS is the client/reseller software we use to provision web hosting accounts and domains ? it's been crucial and Tim and Martha have done a lot of hacking around that plugin to make it not charge people ?? http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/01/building-a-domain-of-ones-own- plugins-add-ons-and-plans/  Building a Domain of One's Own, Part 5  Finally, the early thoughts around syndication in Domain of One's Own were laid down here. Tim and Martha had a major breakthrough with developing this approach out in some really powerful ways, but the adding specific data to sites at the point of installation of the application with Installatron was a game changer for us. Eight months later (see follow-up posts below on building out community site), Martha and Tim came as close to a seamless syndication hub as you're gonna see in a distributed system like this. http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/03/unified-syndication-of-a-domain-of-ones- own/ Also related, Tim blogged his first pass at building a community site in Spring 2013 ? this would be the basis of the brilliance that is community.umwdomains.com: http://archive.timmmmyboy.com/2013/03/building-a- syndication-framework-for-the-domain-of-ones-own/)  ##  Domain of One's Own: It's Official  Below are the posts from Tim and Martha that track the progress of Domain of One's Own up and until are present moment.  Lessons Learned Week 1: Not even a week into the project Martha shares out what we learned so far, the great promotion, inevitable gotchas of email blacklists, the dreams vs the reality of getting students onboard, and the fact that this is gonna be a learning experience, so start learning from ours. http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2013/08/28/75-weeks-into-a-domain-of-ones-own/  Custom Installation Packages: As we started settling in during the Fall, Martha started building on Tim's work in the Spring with Installatron, and started created custom packages that students could install. For example, custom WordPress setups with particular themes, plugins, and pre-defined pages/posts that a course or department could use to create portfolios. The full power of Domains is starting to sink in. http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2013/09/11/packaging-a-domain-of-ones-own/   The Six Month Report: Our Provost, Jonathan levin, has been a huge supporter of Domain of one's own, as has President Hurley, so when we were asked to create a report for UMW's Board of Visitors, Martha start doing the deep and rigorous examination of where we are and where we should go. This Burtis at her best, refusing to blindly champion the project (that's my job ?? ), she wants to know what's working, what's not, and how to make it better. This initiative will be successful because of Martha's unbelievably adroit leadership in refusing to accept the blanket assumptions that it is ""the next thing"" or ""truly innovative."" There is no doubt she believes in its power ? she not only dreamed it up with the rest of us almost a decade ago, she also helped build it! ? -but she is an exacting mind that is going make sure it remains true to its vision and we continue to push hard on making it authentic. http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2014/02/24/six-months-into-domain-of-ones-own/  Details about Infrastructure/Custom Code: Not to be outdone, Tim goes on a tear as we were preparing for the first cancelled Domain Incubator conference in Atlanta(there was to be another, and may be another yet ?? ) at blogs a recap of all the work we have done in terms of documentation Domain of One's Own for our community, a close look at our server setup down to the specs, a recap of the software, and custom Installatron code available on GitHub. It's a move towards starting to share as much as we can in some coherent space, something we're continually working towards.  Teaching Models for UMW Domains: It's like a tennis match at this point, Tim then Martha then TIm and now martha again ?? This posts lays out how students and faculty are actually using it in the community. Portfolios, blogging, course sites, digital projects, etc. It's a great read to start getting a sense of how all the technical infrastructure starts feeding a culture of empowered creators on the web. http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2014/03/05/a-few-models-of-teaching-in-domain-of-ones-own/  Building a Community-base Syndication Hub: The final two posts get at what I think is what might be the most amazing think DTLT has done yet as a group. if building and installing our own pacemaker wasn't enough, TIm and Martha nailed the community side of things and built a syndicated community hub that aggregates every post from every installed application on the server to one site: community.umwdomains.com. Tim takes you through their process in this post: http://timmmmyboy.com/posts/putting-the-community-in-commodity-web-hosting. Martha adds to that the fact that the work they have done allows us to not only assign data to various sites, posts, and processes that was impossible within a single WordPress multisite, but also enables us to expose the broader activity through aggregate data through such a community hub. http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2014/03/05/visualizing-exposing-domain-of-ones-own-activity/  ## A Handy Dandy Hand-Out  FInally, Ryan Brazell has put together a handout that Martha and Tim have tweaked for their presentation to the Board of Visitors last week. This document provides a far more coherent and targeted overview of all this work and more. It comes highly recommended as a piece that will give someone a sense of what's at work here without so much of the overly technical, insider language when it comes to administering a server, edtech, and the web more generally. It was a stroke of genius on Ryan's part to frame this out for a broader audience so that the work we are doing can appeal to as many folks as possible. View it here.  I have to believe the only reason people aren't more blown away by what we've been up to is because a) they don't yet fully grok it; or b) they haven't been paying attention. But I am working on making sure all that changes very soon! Cole Camplese asked me how UMW Domains different from UMW Blogs? I will write a far more detailed response soon, but let me say very briefly here that Domains is the apotheosis of UMW Blogs. It takes the vision of the web as learning platform to the next level, and by virtue of that provides a student- centric technical ecosystem that can then become part and parcel of a broader, cross-discipline curriculum for digital literacy. It is the futureƒ.GET ON THE BUS!!!  Ok, but now I have to get to this other post I have to write so I can then write another post before I dialogue in another post with Mike Caulfield. TIme to make the donuts!  "Jim Groom,Playing Host to Higher Ed's Long Overdue Web Party,http://bavatuesdays.com/playing-host-to-higher-eds-long-overdue-web-party/,4/15/2014,"My last post got me thinking about some pretty basic ideas when it comes to some of the approaches for edtech I've been going on about recently.  Cheap commodity web hosting has been around for roughly fifteen years. There's nothing radical about it other than higher ed's inability to fathom a vision of the web that empowers faculty, staff, and students alike to become a node on the open web.  Nothing we are proposing in Domain of One's Own is at all radical save, perhaps, the idea of including a domain with the web hosting. Schools like the University of Washington have been offering their community shared hosting for a while, they just place no real emphasis on a narrative of empowerment and potentiality. Seems to me they aren't effectively communicating what their community has at its disposal.  The fact web hosting seems radical to so many reinforces just how all consuming the learning management system (LMS) has become in any and all discussions about educational technology.  After my recent talk at Sloan-C's Emerging Technologies Conference I was floored by how many of the questions were centered around the impossibility of teaching and learning outside the LMS. There was a quiet sense of desperation at the suggestion of a more reasonable and relevant approach to the web in higher ed that, by the way, doesn't replace the LMS, but simply provides a more sophisticated environment for the teaching and learning online. Matt Crosslin covers all this far better than me in his ""LMSification of the Educational Narrative"" post, it comes strongly recommended.  So, I'm hoping the ice is starting crack a bit. Bluehost was a Platinum sponsor at Sloan-C, a company that can actually scale hosting for any size university in the country. What's more, if you don't want to buy a domain for everyone at your university or college, then don't. Get a single domain and run shared hosting for the community from there. Get something like umw.domains (.domains is a cool new extensions offered by ICANN, Tim Owens picked up this one) or stonybrook.domains or wsuv.domains or cuny.domains or tru.domains or oklahoma.domains or yale.domains, etc. and run hosting for the entire campus through Bluehost. You can have jgroom.umw.domains, etc.  What's nice about this approach is faculty, staff and students who really see the need for their own domain can buy it themselves, and point it to their hosting space and create an addon or parked domain. At the very least we could start bringing back the basic, powerful possibilities of hosting for campus communities in order to start updating the original vision of tilde spaces (umw.edu/~jgroom) back in the day. This is fairly basic stuff, and there are companies like Bluehost that can easily scale this for educational institutions.  What I found strange at Sloan-C is that Bluehost couldn't seem to sell this basic idea effectively. Their focus session was centered around creating ""Faculty Assessment Portfolios."" An exploration into the territory of creating portfolios for faculty promotion, tenure and the like. I couldn't think of a more fraught space for them to try and break into higher ed through. Seems to me their Spoke project is exactly what they need to focus on, selling hosting as the web-friendly platform higher ed has forsaken. A rally cry to bring back experimentation and innovation to campuses on the back of Bluehost's servers. But, alas, they seem to want to fix faculty portfolios for promotion and tenure. Fail.  The problem there is that while Bluehost has the salespeople and the developers, they don't seem to have faculty and educational technologists working closely with them on this. This is why Canvas was so smart hiring folks like Jared Stein; he knows how university culture works, he's developed courses for faculty and students. Jared is someone who can guide you to what's needed from such an experience. From what I understand, Bluehost's Spoke has a slick dashboard that shares all sorts of details of folks at your school. They even suggested they were working on a ""Reclaim Your Domain"" piece that will pull in your Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. accounts ? they were vague, but it piqued my interest. And while I'm sure all of this is proprietary, designed specifically for their customized control panel (none of it's gonna be freely shared) I can live with that if they could actually sell the remarkable potential for universities they're sitting on.  But they can't articulate it. What a shame. It comes down to a failure of communication. This is what we all need to push on, I think this is an important project for higher ed more generally, not so much that it's the cutting edge, but precisely because its not. It's the open web and it returns us to a sense of the wonder at the heart of that model for teaching and learning. It also pushes us to redefine how we manage data, identities, and sharing. It's still the key to a fundamental shift in how we think about the university as a series of open and connected nodes that will start tearing us free from the broadcast infrastructure that everywhere imprisons us.  "Audrey Watters,Beneath the Cobblestones... A Domain of One's Own,http://hackeducation.com/2014/04/25/domain-of-ones-own-incubator-emory,4/25/2014,"read  Here are the slides and notes from my keynote today at the Domain of One's Own Incubator at Emory University. Initially I wanted to talk about ""Why A Domain of One's Own Matters"" but it turned into more a rant (surprise surprise) about the politics of technology.  ""What technologies have you seen lately that you like?"" people always ask me. It's a trick question, I reckon. ""What in ed-tech is exciting? What in ed-tech innovative?"" These questions make me sigh. Heavily.  But I am on record  ?  several times in several places  ?  calling ""Domain of One's Own"" one of the most important and innovative initiatives in ed-tech today. The responses I get to such an assertion are always revealing.  Oh sure, I get plenty of nods and shouts that ""hell yeah, Jim Groom rocks!"" (which he does. and his team rocks even more).  But then too, I get a fair amount of pushback. People question, ""What the hell is 'Domain of One's Own'?"" Or ""Is it like that Seinfeld episode?"" Or ""I've never heard of it. Has Techcrunch written about it?"" Or more commonly, ""Why is having a blog a big deal?"" Or ""My university gave us web space back in 1994."" Or  ?  in a nutshell, I suppose  ?  ""I don't get it. How is it innovative?""  ### I. Innovation  What's different, what's special about the ""Domain of One's Own"" project?  It isn't simply ""a blog."" It isn't simply slash your user name on the university's dot edu.  The initiative represents a kind of open learning  ?  learning on the Web and with the Web, learning that is of the Web  ?  and all along the way, ""Domain of One's Own"" offers a resistance to the silos of the traditional learning management system and of traditional academic disciplines.  It highlights the importance of learner agency, learning in public, control over one's digital identity, and the increasing importance of Web literacies.  But I recognize that the ""Domain of One's Own"" initiative does, in many ways, run counter to how the tech industry and the ed-tech industry today define and market ""innovation""  ?  and how in turn we teachers and students, we consumers, we ""users""  ?  are meant to view and admire such developments.  This is innovation.  This is innovation.  These aren't ed-tech products, of course. And Google Glass and Google's Self- Driving Car  ?  for the time being, at least  ?  are not being heavily marketed to schools, unlike Google Apps for Education, Google Course Builder, Google Chrome, Google Chromebooks, Google Hangouts, Google Helpouts, Android tablets, YouTube, Google Books, Google MOOCs, Google Scholar, and so on.  We can probably debate whether or not the Google products pushed on schools are really that innovative. And perhaps  ?  and sadly  ?  that's what we've come to expect from ed-tech: it is acceptably behind-the-curve.  Yet unlike technologies that are specifically geared towards classrooms, Google doesn't really suffer from its association with ed-tech, does it? Instead, it's credited with bringing a long-overdue technical boost to schools. And it's free!  Of course, you could argue that Google writ large does have an education- oriented mission of sorts  ?  ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""  And yet in undertaking this mission, let's be clear, Google's ""innovation"" is not associated that closely with educational institutions  ?  be they libraries or universities or K?12 schools. In other words, the company positions its products as a benefit for educational institutions, but Google is not really of educational institutions. Google clearly brands itself as a tech innovation, a Silicon Valley innovation, even though you could argue it's surely a Stanford University-born one.  You could argue too that as Google has grown, so too have the implications of its efforts to ""organize the world's information."" These implications are political. Economic. Technological. Scientific. Cultural. And they are global.  Google looks less and less like a library card catalog, if you will, that helps us find what we're searching for on the Web. That's particularly true in light of its some of its most recent acquisitions: a company that builds military robots, a company that manufactures solar-powered drones, and one that makes Internet-connected thermostats and smoke alarms, for example.  No doubt, these are new ways, new products that use ""the world's information."" Often, that use our information.  We're told this exchange  ?  this extraction, if you will  ?  fosters innovation.  Google Glass and Google's Self-Driving Car are initiatives of the company's mysterious laboratory Google X. Although Google prides itself (and brands itself) as being an ""innovative"" company, Google X is even more ambitious. The work of Google X involves technology ""moon shots,"" as CEO and co-founder Larry Page describes them.  Here's how an article in Bloomberg Business Week describes the lab, a gentle reminder of the military history from which computer research emerged:  > Google X seeks to be an heir to the classic research labs, such as the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bomb, and Bletchley Park, where code breakers cracked German ciphers and gave birth to modern cryptography.  >  > ƒ""Google believes in and enables us to do things that wouldn't be possible in academia,"" says Chris Urmson, a former assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon [and now the head of the self-driving car project].  ""Things that wouldn't be possible in academiaƒ""  Perhaps because academia doesn't have the resources. Perhaps because of a focus (real or perceived) on theoretical, rather than applied research. Perhaps because of a disregard or distaste for the commercial. Perhaps because academia  ?  some parts of it at least, and some institutions ? likes to minimize or ignore or distance itself from its connections to the development of war technologies  ?  as does the current computer industry, no doubt. Perhaps because academia doesn't do that good a job at promoting its scholarship to the public  ?  you know, ""in organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful."" Perhaps because academia doesn't do a good job of hyping its achievements.  Perhaps because innovation is increasingly defined as something that comes from industry and not the university, something that is fostered in the private sector and not the public.  Much of what happens at Google X is secret, but among its other research projects we do know of: Google Contact Lenses, an experiment to see if tiny sensors on contact lenses can offer a non-intrusive way to monitor diabetics' glucose levels. Project Loon, an experiment to use high altitude balloons to deliver Internet to people in remote areas. And Google Brain, a vast computer simulation of the human brain, a ""neural network"" of thousands of connected computer processors  ?  ""Deep Learning"" this is called.  A couple of names of those who've worked at Google X in addition to Google co- founder Sergey Brin: Sebastian Thrun. Andrew Ng.  Sebastian Thrun, one of the creators of Google's self-driving car, who also happens to be a Stanford artificial intelligence professor, who also happens to be the co-founder of Udacity, an online education startup.  Andrew Ng, one of the researchers on Google Brain, who also happens to be a Stanford artificial intelligence professor, who also happens to be the co- founder of Coursera, another online education startup.  Now, I'm disinclined to talk to you this afternoon about MOOCs. Dammit, I'm here to talk about the ""Domain of One's Own""! And God knows, we've spilled enough ink on the topic of MOOCs over the course of the last 18 months or so. But MOOCs are a subtext of this talk, I confess.  It's possible Thrun and Ng's work at Google X might just be an inconsequential line on their CVs  ?  the ties between Stanford and Google ain't no big thing.  But I think this connection between Google X and MOOCs is noteworthy. It points towards one vision for the future of teaching and learning with technology, one vision of what happens to the content we create as teachers and learners, one vision of who owns and controls all the data.  It's also interesting to consider why some people balk at a ""Domain of One's Own"" being innovative and yet clamor over MOOCs as the greatest and newest thing education has ever seen.  And I'll add too, it is striking to me  ?  it's part of the motivation for my writing a book on the history of automation in education  ?  that two of the leading scientists at Google X, two of the leading scientists in the field of artificial intelligence  ?  and artificial intelligence at scale  ?  have opted to launch companies that purport to address developing human intelligence, through instruction and content delivery at scale.  ### II. Scale  MOOCs as ideology. Google as ideology. ""Scale"" as ideology.  Scale is important vis-a-vis tech companies like Google and their global reach. It's important in their economic impact and in the way that economic growth  ?  particularly venture capital funded growth  ?  gets framed.  Scale is important in the breadth of tech companies' offerings (particularly in the case of Google, which is hardly just a search engine anymore, although it does remain  ?  if you judge it by its revenues  ?  an advertising company).  ""Scale"" is important as we see the number of sectors being transformed (or threatened with transformation) by new technologies  ?  as media studies professor Siva Vaidhyanathan has described it in his book The Googlization of Everything.  ""Scale"" is important too in how many of these new technologies work  ?  how they work practically and how they work ideologically. By that I mean that ""scale"" and this business-technological lens is increasingly framing the way we view the world, so much so that we must ask ""Does it scale?"" about every idea or initiative, good or bad.  And when we ask ""Does it scale?"" we often mean, ""Can we replicate this across systems in an orderly, standardized way thanks to Internet connectivity and proprietary software solutions and venture capital?"" Or we mean ""Is this idea ïthe next Google'?""  Our technological world necessitates thinking in and working in and expanding at scale. Or that's the message from the tech and business sector at least: scale is necessary; technological progress demands it.  And here again, we can see that just as the ""Domain of One's Own"" does not fit in an industry-oriented definition of ""innovation,"" nor does it neatly fit into this view of ""scale"" either  ?  even, I'd argue, as we see the project spread from the University of Mary Washington to Emory University and elsewhere. The ""Domain of One's Own"" initiative grows through the hard work of community-building and capacity-building, not simply through technical replication.  But Googleƒ Google scales.  ""Scale"" is important to all of Google's efforts. Google works, of course, at ""Web scale,"" and scale is, if nothing else, important in the size and distribution of Google's infrastructure  ?  its server farms.  Take, for example, every time you type a word or phrase into Google's search box. That query hits between 700 and 1000 separate computers. These machines scan indexes of the Web and generate about 5 million search results, delivered back to you in .16 seconds.  That's the infrastructure for one search. It's hard to fathom the complexity and, well, the scale involved in all the search queries Google handles.  And more: it's hard to imagine the complexity and scale involved across all the products and services Google offers, all of which are now covered by one Terms of Service agreement  ?  your data and your profile shared across them all. What you search for on Google. Your Gmail. Your Google Calendar plans. Your friends on Google+. What you've bought with Google Wallet. What you've downloaded from Google Play. What you've watched on YouTube. Where you head on Google Maps (and by extension, where the Google Self-Driving Car would know to take you.) What you spy with Google Glass.  So much data.  ### III. Data  We are all creating mind-bogglingly vast amounts of data  ?  in increasing volume, speed, and complexity. In 2012, IBM pegged this at about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created every day. No doubt that figure has only increased in the past 2 years.  This is, of course, ""big data."" Numbers too big for your Casio calculator. Numbers too big for your Excel spreadsheet.  And this is what many entrepreneurs, technologists, technocrats, politicians, venture capitalists, and quants are quite giddy about. Big data  ?  capturing it, processing it, analyzing it  ?  all of which will purportedly bring about more innovation. More innovation in education. More innovation in education at scale, even.  Much of this data explosion comes from various types of sensors  ?  indeed, the number of Internet-connected devices in US homes today now outnumbers the number of people in the country itself. Devices like, for example, the Nest thermostat that Google just acquired.  But plenty of this data is human-generated  ?  if not specifically as what we call ""user-generated content, "" then as ""data-exhaust,"" that is all sorts of metadata that many of us are often quite unaware that we're creating.  Of course, the general public probably is a bit more aware of metadata now, thanks to the revelations last summer of Edward Snowden, the former CIA analyst who disclosed the vast surveillance efforts of the National Security Agency: the collection of massive amounts of data from telephone and technology companies. ""Email, videos, photos, voice-over-IP chats, file transfers, social networking details, and more"" siphoned from Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Skype, AOL, World of Warcraft, Angry Birds and so on. Encryption undermined. Malware spread. Our social connections mapped. Warrantless spying by governments ? not just on suspected terrorists, but on all of us.  As privacy researcher and activist Chris Soghoian quipped on Twitter, Google has built the greatest global surveillance system. It's no surprise that the NSA has sought to to use it too.  Google knows a lot about us. What we search for. Who we email. And when. Where we live. Where we're going. What we watch. What we write. What we read. What we buy.  It mines this data purportedly to offer us better products and services and, of course, to sell ads.  And again, here is where a ""Domain of One's Own"" runs counter to what is a dominant trend in technology today  ?  particularly a growing trend in education whereby all this data and all this metadata will be used to ""personalize education.""  A ""Domain of One's Own"" asks us to consider the infrastructure. It asks us to understand the Web and our place on it. It asks to us to pay attention to the content we create  ?  as teachers and as students  ?  and to weigh where it best resides  ?  who has access to it, and for how long.  It prompts us to ask ""what data are we creating"" as learners and ""who owns it."" Who tracks us. Who profits.  As our worlds become increasingly mediated by computing machines, we're encouraged to hand over more details of our lives, more data to Google (and to other technology companies, of course.)  Most of us think little about this. We shrug. We agree to the Terms of Service without reading them, often meaning we've agreed to hand over our data, to give up control over what's done with it. We acquiesce more and more of our privacy. In doing so, we're assured, technology will give us access to better stuff, to more ""innovation.""  ### IV. Magic  As Arthur C. Clarke once famously said, ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""  Technology companies benefit when we think this is all magic. There is little incentive for them to equip us with the critical and the technical capacities to run our own servers, to build our own applications, to use and contribute to open source software, to claim our place on the open Web, and ultimately here, to challenge their business models. Because let's be clear: for many companies, theirs is a business model predicated on monetizing the content and the data we create.  A ""Domain of One's Own"" builds literacies so that the technology of the Web is distinguishable from magic, so those who understand how to manipulate its symbols are not high priests or magicians, so that carving out and operating your own little piece on the Web is manageable. From there perhaps teachers and students will feel empowered to explore more of technology's terrain, so they feel empowered, even, to resist its ""Googlization.""  One quick aside about ""magic""  ?  because I'm a folklorist by training, and I don't want to dismiss or belittle a belief in wonder. Nor do I want us to move away from a world of wonder to a world of technocracy, to simply reduce what we do and what we make to terms like ""user generated content"" or ""personal data"" or ""code."" How cold and empty these sound. Love letters reduced to a status update, love songs, their associated metadata. Human communication as a transaction, not an expression.  I think we've convinced ourselves that we've wrested the Internet away from its military origins to do just that, to make a space for poetic self- expression, to make a space for self-directed learning. But I'm not really certain we were successful. In fact, I'm deeply pessimistic about the path that technology, particularly education technology, is taking.  ""I am a pessimist,"" to quote Antonio Gramsci, ""because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.""  I am a skeptic about much of ed-tech because I am a critic of late capitalism, of imperialism, of militarism and surveillance  ?  I think we err when we ignore or forget the role that education and that technology play therein.  I do try to be an optimist. Those of working in education are by necessity, Gardner Campbell has suggested. As he wrote last year, ""It seems to me that educators, no matter how skeptical their views (skepticism is necessary but not sufficient for an inquiring mind), are implicitly committed to optimism. Otherwise, why learn? and why teach?""  Indeed. And we in education believe in ideas, sure. We believe in knowledge. We believe, I'd add too, that through collective contemplation, intellectual reciprocity, and deliberate and wise action, the future can be better. But mostly, I think, educators are optimists because we believe in people.  I'm here today speaking to you because of people. Oh sure, no doubt, I'm here because I do own my own domain. I've leveraged the website I control to tell stories about education and technology, stories that are often very different than those promoted by the business and tech industries, from those promoted by education as well.  But I mean before that. Before I bought the www dot hackeducation dot com domain. Before I bought www dot audrey watters dot com. Way before. A decade ago.  A decade ago I was a grad student, working on my PhD in comparative literature. I didn't start a blog then to talk about academia. Rather, my husband had been diagnosed with liver cancer. He was dying. I was trying to balance care taking him and our 12 year old son. I was losing my world; I was losing my shit. I was trying to still teach classes. I was supposed to be writing a dissertation.  Instead, I wrote a blog.  These were the early days of academic blogging, when there appeared to be very little support for the sorts of public scholarship that we see now via blogs. Many of us wrote under pseudonyms, uncertain if as graduate students or junior faculty, it was really safe for us to be engaged in these public discussions under our real names.  What I found online was not just intellectual camaraderie. I found an incredible community who supported me during my most difficult times in ways that those on my campus never did.  One of those people was David Morgen. I consider him a dear friend and an amazing colleague, even though neither of us are doing now what we thought we'd be doing in academia a decade ago. And even though, until yesterday, we'd never actually met face-to-face.  And that, if anything, is what's magic about technology.  Not how Google can mount a tiny camera onto some plastic eyeglasses. Not how all the data it's collected from its Google Maps project can now be used to help power an autonomous vehicle. Not spam filters on emails. Not collaborative editing of documents. Not technology's business models. Not its political and economic powers. Not the obfuscation of these.  What's magic: the ability to connect to other people  ?  and connect in deeply meaningful ways  ?  even though separated by physical space.  ### V. Resistance  Of course, Internet companies like Google love it when we love that capability. That's the stuff of TV ads. Talking to grandparents and grandchildren and astronauts via Google Hangouts. Real tearjerkers.  This desire for human ""connection""  ?  not simply the colder and more technical term ""communication""  ?  is perhaps our weak spot, where these companies can so easily strike, where they can so readily convince us to give up control of our data, our content, our digital identity, to trust them, to let them focus on the technology while we non-technologists focus on the rest.  Perhaps it's what makes education so susceptible to this too  ?  learning can be a moment of such vulnerability and such powerful connection.  But I'd argue too that this desire for connection is just as easily our strength as we grow weary of an emphasis on scaling the technology and scaling the business.  We will, I hope  ?  again, this is why I believe ""A Domain of One's Own"" is so important and so innovative  ?  learn to seize these tools and build something for ourselves. One path forward perhaps, with a nod to Donna Haraway: cyborgs.  ""The main trouble with cyborgs"" she reminds us, ""is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins.""  A ""Domain of One's Own"" is a cyborg tactic, I reckon. Kin to the learning management system. Kin to Web 2.0. But subversive to today's Internet technologies and today's educational technologies, connected as these are, as Haraway's manifesto reminds us, to command-control-communication-intelligence.  A cyborg tactic, an ""illegitimate offspring,"" the Domain of One's Own is fiercely disloyal to the LMS  ?  Jim Groom and his team always make that incredibly clear. And I hope eventually too, fiercely disloyal to Google.  The Domain of One's Own initiative prompts us to not just own our own domain  ?  our own space on the Web ? but to consider how we might need to reclaim bits and pieces that have already been extracted from us.  It prompts us think critically about what our digital identity looks like, who controls it, who owns our data, who tracks it, who's making money from it. It equips us to ask questions  ?  technical questions and philosophical questions and economic questions and political questions about and for ourselves, our communities, our practices  ?  knowing that we have a stake as actors and not just as objects of technology, as actors and not just objects of education technology.  Graffiti from May '68 in Paris pronounced ""Beneath the cobblestones, the beach."" I know it's hokey to invoke situationist phrases. I realize that the hot new thing would be to invoke Thomas Piketty. But I love that situationist phrase. It's so punk rock  ?  the idea that if we dig under the infrastructure of society, we'll find something beautiful. The idea that in our hands, this infrastructure  ?  quite frankly  ?  becomes a weapon.  And that's how we resist Google, how we resist the tech industry writ large. And that's why a Domain of One's Own matters, that's why it's incredibly innovative  ?  because it's so wickedly subversive about the whole notion of tech and ed-tech ""innovation.""

I can't speak for the folks at Emory University or my UMW colleagues, but listening to Audrey Watters articulate such a brilliant, poetic, and precise vision of Domain of One's Own as subversive intervention into the current state of the web may very well be the highlight of my professional life up and until this point. Cyborg tactics #4life! My only issue with the talk is that I have to follow it up tomorrow ?? But the talk is just the tip of the iceberg, talking with her and Kin Lane yesterday and today only gets me that much more impassioned and excited about preaching the reclaim word. I'm donning the frock for God, Country, and Domains!!!  "Jim Groom,Post-Conference Sloan-C Interview,http://bavatuesdays.com/post-conference-sloan-c-interview/,4/25/2014,"On Wednesday I had a discussion with Sandra Coswatte, Cathy Arreguin, Zeren Eder, and Holly Rae Bemis-Schurtz of Sloan-C about the presentation I gave at et4online conference . The interview covers a brief history of my beginnings in the field of edtech ? which centers around having gotten a domain and web hosting in 2003. It moves on to my landing a job at UMW, as well as the long history of Domain of One's Own (I've pretty much been doing this one thing in various forms for ten years).  There's a bit of the video wherein I go on a tear about embodiment, philosophy, and the academic reality of domains that makes little to no sense, but when has that ever stopped me? Also, I guess that was part of the fun for me. We were all just rapping. I think the point that is coming back to me again and again these days is just how powerful a platform like UMW Domains could be for empwoering faculty and students to control their work, while at the same time re-imagining curriculum across just about every discipline. A broader, integrated vision of what this project could mean for web literacy is really getting me excited.  "Jim Groom,The Many Faces of Domain,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-many-faces-of-domain/,4/30/2014,"Image credit: The Sydney Morning Herald  It's going to take several posts to try and capture the unbelievable experience that was the Domain Incubator held at Emory University this past weekend ? mad kudos to Pete Rorabough and David Morgen for putting on a stellar event. This post will try and capture an immediate take away from those two days, namely how many different approaches folks can take to Domain of One's Own.  Several of the schools at the incubator were interested in Domain of One's Own as an extension of the work already happening in their writing programs. As Brennan Collins from Georgia State University noted, thinking Domains pedagogically and developing faculty for integrating the digital into their courses is not unlike the Writing Across the Curriculum initiative that's been around since the mid-70s. This struck me as an excellent approach, particularly since I had some personal experience with the movement as a Writing Across the Curriculum fellow at CUNY's College of Staten Island from 2000 to 2003. Such an interdisciplinary frame for integrating digital approaches into the classroom gets away from the potential to relegate the digital to a specific discipline like ""Digital Studies."" The digital is discipline agnostic, it contains them all!  Another approach that I'm deeply enamored of is Audrey Watters's and Kin Lane's ""Reclaim Your Domain"" vision. These two have their intellectual and technical understanding of the web so finely tuned at this moment that it's a real privilege to spend time talking it through with them. And to be clear, Audrey's keynote about Google's nefarious practices and the moral imperative for reclaiming one's online life is the best argument I've heard for this initiative bar none, watch it for yourself ? you'll see what I mean.  And their vision goes beyond just educational institutions, yet I think they both see this space as crucial to the ethos of their work. They point to a bunch of work already happening in the reclaim space such as Learning Locker, the Locker Project, IndieWebCamp, and Zapier to name a few, and there is definitely a sense that this space is started to emerge as an important alternative to fast food socail media. They're on a mission to push people to think about questions of ownership of their online life and do everything possible to educate as many folks about why it's critical to control their data. What's more, they want to connect the technical pieces that makes it possible. I want in on all of this, this is the kind of educational evangelism I would gladly become a crusader for, and it doesn't hurt that Audrey and Kin are the real deal. They're laying down the cobblestones that will bring us to the beach, so to speak ??  Another take away from the Domain Incubator is that there's a lot of folks who are coming to this whole thing with a wealth of experience. One of the many folks I really appreciated over the two days was Clay Fenlason. He works as the director for Georgia Tech's academic technology department, and he has spent a lot of time in the field over the last ten years so he knows of what he speaks. The best part is soon after the conference he started his own blog at unlearned.org and began firing off thought gems.  I'll be talking about the ""Middle Layer"" post he wrote in my next missive on the incubator, but for this one I want to point to his ""Two Deserts"" post in which he talks about his own groups' walkabout in the open source desert that was Sakai back in the mid-2000s. He eloquently captures his own journey trying to create an environment that embraces the web while at the same time engages as many community members as possible:  > Around the same time I think I was going through a desert of my own. It started in a different place, in an open source community. There was this feeling, in the early days of Sakai, that the important thing was to put higher ed back in charge of its core mission, rather than outsourcing it to LMS companies. Never mind the design assumptions implicit in the software, we could work that out as we went. The important thing was that there was a community of people who really cared about the academic mission, working together. We would get to a better place eventually.  >  > It was around 2008 that a few of us started to feel that it wasn't enough, that simply wresting control of our technologies away from proprietary interests wasn't enough to get us into a better place for online learning. Community source was a different way of doing software development, but it wasn't allowing us to rethink the model or take on the deeper challenges and opportunities the Web presented.  >  > I think those of us who drifted from the Sakai community were animated by ideas similar to those behind Domain ? empowering learners as creators, engaging with the Web rather than walling ourselves off from it, unhooking human connections and networks from the administrative superstructure that gets in the way ? but I think we ended up in a very different place. We ended up with an online platform that tried to facilitate these things for you. We call it the Open Academic Environment.  I love the narrative he provides of this journey through trying to find a way to create a better online space for teaching and learning. UMW's DTLT has been on that same trajectory, and the challenge of balancing the coherence provided by prefab learning management systems (LMS) versus the freedom and possibilities of the open web is one just about any school considering Domains will confront. I'm glad Clay appreciated my harping on this point in my talk because as an educational technologist it's impossible to ignore this tension if you want to bring Domain of One's Own to your campus. UMW has made a choice to support the LMS as a baseline, but we continue to invest more time, energy, and evangelizing into open web technologies.  These various faces of Domains is how we start thinking more pointedly about how this platform, for lack of a better word, becomes integrally linked to cross-disciplinary curriculum and personal empowerment ? so it's just not another alternative to the LMS. It's markedly different from that system, and no longer to we get trapped in the position of pitting one against the other and losing any momentum for alternatives beyond the monolithic solution. The LMS does x,y, and z very well, but like Andy Rush noted, ""You can't shave your head in an LMS.""  Finally, the biggest take away in this regard was that it's not all or nothing, Emory University is doing Domain of One's Own with everything from a domain and web hosting to a Weebly account. And guess what, they both framed an experience that put the student in charge of their own work on their own space. I understand the limits of Weebly when we talk more literally about ownership, but what struck me is that the entire conversation shifted to personal spaces rather than centralized, institutional systems, and that move is not trivial. I'm not sure a domain and web hosting is the only way to skin this cat, and I think we have to be far less righteous in our work with students and faculty at UMW when it comes to exploring options like mapping domains on services like Tumblr, UMW Blogs, Google Sites, etc. There's a deep tension there too, and I think that's important. We need to push on the tensions and ask ourselves if there is any way to live a wrong domain rightly.     You could also argue Domains provides an opportunity to revisit questions of cohesion that encourages IT organizations to start rethinking their infrastructure. The affordances of push-pull technology has still been widely ignored in the IT systems we use, and our work might be the opportunity to start making inroads there. UMW is exploring virtualized servers through services liek Amazon Web Services in large part because of the work we started with UMW Domains, that does not suck ??  "Jim Groom,Hitchcock Motifs,http://bavatuesdays.com/hitchcock-motifs/,4/30/2014,"UMW Art History professor JeanAnn Dabb is teaching a Freshman Seminar on Alfred Hitchcock. Few subjects in this world are more compelling than Hitchcock's films, and it's hard to think of a better excuse to run a course blog. So, that's exactly what JeanAnn did, and you can find it here: http://hitchcock.umwblogs.org. That's right, a little bit of old school UMW Blogs to temper all this Domain of One's Own rah rah rah ??  Hitchcock in the Simpsons  What I like about how JeanAnn ran this course blog is she had students write about different elements of Hitchcock's films over the course of the semester. They captured the various motifs Hitchcock employed across his films and the innumerable homages to Hitchcock's work by other filmmakers and in pop culture. They also wrote about his ongoing legacy (is Vertigo (1958) his/the greatest film of his career/all time?), as well as his impact on contemporary art. I love the various lenses she provides her class to think through the Master's work.  Stan Douglas's recreation of the set of Marnie is a loop of a scene in which Marnie robs the office where she works. It's reshot in a modern setting, with computers instead of typewriters, though it is in black and white rather than color. Read more by clicking on the image.  It's really compelling stuff, and I have spent way too much time reading through the posts. My personal favorites are from the motif category in which students trace various recurring themes through his films. Various students' posted about the ways in which Hitchcock subtly and brilliantly manipulates the viewer in his films. One can often find themselves in a compromised position as a result, which is illustrated brilliantly in this post about the ""GunCam"" ?  or the first person shooter perspective in Spellbound (1945).  GunCam: First Person Shooter from Hitchcock's Spellbound  The post by Mrs. Atwater, ""The Audience and the Film,"" does an excellent job sharing some of the particular moments in which Hitchcock is breaking the fourth wall and acknowledging the audience's role in the action.  In Strangers on Train, Bruno engages the audience head-on as the other audience is seduced by the action.  Joseph Cotton breaking the fourth wall in Shadow of a Doubt  Grace Kelly in Rear Window communicating with the audience  The motif of criss-cross in Strangers on a Train is the focus of another post, which uses screenshots and GIFs (a staple for film blogs now) to capture the various ways Hitchcock communicated his themes and motifs though this visual medium. As an aside, I love that one of the GIFs they grabbed from the web for their post was from my own blog ??  Criss-crossed traintracks in Strangers on a Train  Criss-crossed feet  Criss-crossed audience (a GIF furnished by the bava :))  And that's not all, there are posts covering the motifs of stairs, tense drivers, and falls from high places, and the various posts really make for some compelling discussions about Hitchcock's work. What's even better is the web is an endless supply of inspiration and resources when it comes to film, and the students have not been shy at all about using them liberally when it comes to screenshots, GIFs, and videos.  Finally, one of the first student posts on the course blog was about an essay by Robert Stam and Roberta Pearson in the Hitchcock Reader wherein they discuss voyeurism in Hitchcock's films. In particular, they refer to Jimmy Stewart's line in Rear Window ""like a bug under glass,"" to frame the reflexive nature of watching in his films. This struck me because last year during the Mario Bava film festival Paul Bond and I were running the discussion of Bava's debt to Hitchcock came up again and again. As soon as I read the line ""bug under glass"" it immediately made me think of the scene in Mario Bava's 1971 Twitch of the Death Nerve wherein a bug is pinned and struggling.  This shot certainly resonates with Stewart's line, and throughout this film the viewer partakes in thirteen murders from the perspective of the unknown killer. A trick that would become stock over the decade with the rise of the slasher film. You can argue that Bava is quoting Hitchcock here, recognizing he's about to create one of the most violently voyeuristic genres in film. But Bava wasn't limited to obscure quotes and bugs for his inspiration from Hitchcock, he also liked Hitchcockian stairs a lot!  Stairs from mario bava's Kill Baby, Kill!  OK, that was a lot of fun, but now I must get back to my flooding basement.

Turns out this semester was a bear, and I am just getting around to updating my last five talks on EagleEye.

The presentation explores how higher ed turned away from the open web as platform at the turn of the millenium in exchange for coherence, security, and ease-of-use, the issue remains what was lost in that sacrifice. You can see the slide below and read more about the rpesentation on Jim Groom's blog here.  >  > On April 10th Groom delivered the keynote presentation at the Sloan-C Emerging Technologies Conference titled ""Domains in the Afterglow"" that was a further tightening of the talk delivered at Baruch College almost two weeks earlier. The focal point being how can universities more broadly support an infrasstructure beyond the learning management system that enables digital literacy and creates a student-centric technology ecosystem. Below is a video of the talk, and here is a trail of the Twitter conversation that resulted from this presentation. You can read more about this presnetation on Jim Groom's blog here.  >  > More recently, on April 26th and 27th Jim Groom was invited down to Emory University, along with Tim Owens and Martha Burtis, to discuss Domain of One's Own with representatives from various colleges in the Atlanta region at the Domain Incubator. This was a confernece inspired by the work happening at UMW, and the two-day intesive program was dedicated to sharing the work UMW and Emory (who is running a pilot of Domains this year) have been doing over the last year. The keynote presentation Groom delivered was titled ""Domain of One's Own: a Problem of Coherence"" and you can see the video below. The talk, which relies heavily on the ideas and words of Jon Udell, explores the deeper cultural implications of Domain of One's Own by taking a broader view of the idea of coherent personal digital archives as somethign we will all need in the near future.  "Jim Groom,A Problem of Coherence,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-problem-of-coherence/,5/9/2014,"Almost two weeks ago (is it really two weeks already?) I attended the Domain Incubator at Emory Unviersity wherein we had a focused discussion about several of the possibilities and issues surrounding Domain of One's Own. As a quick aside, isn't it cool this initaitve has already had it's own dedicated conference? ?? Last week I wrote about the many faces of domains, and Clay Fenlason and Pete Rorabaugh have been on a blogging tear in the wake of the incubator. Whereas I still haven't blogged about the presentation I gave on Saturday afternoon framed around Domains and the problem of coherence, so I figured I should write a bit about that before it's gone.  I'll start by saying this wasn't one of my best presentations, and I don't necessarily mean that in a self-deprecating way. Truth be told I didn't even really give this presentation, Jon Udell did. I spent 20-25 of the 37 minutes of the presentation playing clips from Udell's 2007 presentation ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology."" I've been retuning to this gem again and again when trying to conceptualize Domain of One's Own, and I thought this would be the perfect occasion to suggest the ideas driving Domain of One's Own are far broader than just education.  In fact, the clips I included during this talk were part of another talk I gave for Campus Technology almost a year ago. I was trying to making the argument that Domain of One's Own repositions the question of coherence to the individual scale rather than the enterpirse ? and syndication helps provide the glue. It's a move to the idea of faculty, staff, and students becoming a node within a broader network that ideally moves well beyond the limited, and often arbitrary, frame of education.  Having said all this, I'm not sure I was entirely successful with this approach. Udell made his points brilliantly, and I think they re-inforced many of the discussions we had as part of the incubator. His articulate presience is remarkable. But the awkwardness of playing eight or nine 2-3 minute audio clips changes the sense of energy I'm used to feeding off while presenting. In some ways that was good because it switched the attention from me as performer to Udell as thinker, but in other ways I felt I was playing them something they could just as easily have listened to at home. I punctuated his points within the context of the conference, but I'm not sure I had the rhythm and delivery to make it not seem awkward.  What's more, I was actually letting Udell give the talk, which might have been better dealt with by trying to build on his work from seven years ago with my own ideas. It was an experiment born out of the fact that I felt the ""Domains in the Afterglow"" talk I had orginally created with the Incubator in mind back in January had run its course after Sloan-C. I referenced that idea in the beginning of this talk by running through my original slidebeck and then throwing it out, which points to a larger tension in my talks recently. Giving a talk a few times is really good for it's flow and rhythm, but not always so good for my relationship to it. It quickly begins to feel rote. I depend on the energy of not knowing what I'm gonna say next, so having an extemporaneous conversation, if you will, with a 2007 talk with Udell was my way at this. Not sure it worked, but then again I'm not sure it didn't either. The fact I remain so uncomfortable about it may be telling, or maybe it isn't. Either way, I'm gonna try this one again in one fashion or another because I now know it's not rote yet ??  "Jim Groom,Has the Time Arrived for Hosted Lifebits?,http://bavatuesdays.com/has-the-time-arrived-for-hosted-lifebits/,5/12/2014,"I'm a big fan of Kin Laneïs for many reasons: he's west coast cool, he's passionate about what he believes in, he's a technical wizard, and he wraps that all up with some intense creativity and vision. What one might call the complete package. He's ramping up his Reclaim efforts currently, and we got to spend some time together at the Emory Domain Incubator to start imagining what that might look like more broadly.  One of the ideas he was toying around with I really loved came as a response to the presentation Tim Owens and Martha Burtis gave about their work setting up the Domain of One's Own environment at UMW. They talked about hacking the management and billing software WHMCS to hide all traces of money from all students, staff and faculty using the service. This makes sense because none of them pay anything to get a domain and web hosting. So much of WHMCS is defined around domains costs, billing notices, overdue warnings, etc. The software is designed for folks who want to resell domains and hosting so this makes sense, no one really buys that software in order to give products away ?? So as Tim and Martha quickly learned, erasing any mention of money from this application for UMW Domains was hard ? the transactional logic is written into its DNA.  What Kin suggested during their session is that perhaps the WHMCS layer needs to function more as an educational/social experience that explains how domains and web hosting works, helps people understand how to think like the web in a contextual manner, and links a community together. I love this idea, and it's funny that an article Kin linked to on Twitter just over an hour ago in Wired about the Indie Box project gets at some of this in there reference to an open source application marketplace on these personal servers. But two of the issues I see with that project are a) you have to pay $500 for your own server, and b) you have to manage your own server.  Don't get me wrong, the vision behind this project is awesome, and I'm a big fan. I'm just wondering if the hosted part of our identities on the web doesn't still make some sense. You can still move your life bits to open source applications on a solid web host, and you can still have a marketplace for open source applications, Installatron is a pretty solid example of this. Kin has talked about building a marketplace of APIs that pull your contributions from various third-party, NSA-friendly platforms into your own server ? but do you want to opt out all together? Maybe, but managing a server under your desk was never much fun, and I can't imagine it will be that much better now.  So, thinking about this the idea Jon Udell was exploring in 2007 about hosted lifebits might be a conversation we're ready to have more broadly currently given that the NSA is scanning our emails and Google and Facebook are hoarding our data. I think many of us would be willing to pay for hosted services that enable us to store and share our various digital lifebits, providing access and privacy as needed. In many ways Kin's idea of the re-imagined layer for domain and hosting management might consider what this might look like as a way at this issue. What if people created API tools you could pay a nominal fee for to ensure you could regularly archive your tweets, Flickr images, Facebook updates, etc? What if you could go beyond that an ensure some consistency of your online environments in terms of links, media, etc? Engineering an open web can only happen when each of us starts reclaiming some of the fundamental pieces of our personal digital archives, which does not necessarily mean taking on the role of full blown server admin. Collaborative labor collectives can be useful in some scenarios ??  This is one of the things I really want to start thinking about in relationship to Reclaim Your Domain. How can I start reclaiming my various online spaces that I've been living in for the last decade or more to go through the process of consolidating and ensuring a future for these conversations within and beyond the moment.  "Jim Groom,Lost in the Stacks,http://bavatuesdays.com/lost-in-the-stacks/,5/27/2014,"I saw the following tweet and got interetedƒ  > Mentioned on last week's show: http://t.co/olHfEJmhyX #ATLDomain #ReclaimHosting #DomainOfOnesOwn  >  >  ?  Lost in the Stacks (@LibraryRadio) May 27, 2014  And as a result of my curiosity I spent the last hour listening to a discussion about expunging your digital history from a pretty awesome group of librarians at Georgia Tech, including Charlie Bennett, Ameet Doshi, Alexandra Low, Perry Shuman, Cody Turner, and Anthony Nguyen. The show is called ""Lost in the Stacks,"" and I believe it airs once a week on Georgia Tech's student- run radio station WREK. Their show description rules:  > The one and only Research Library Rock'n'Roll show! Ameet and Charlie from the Georgia Tech Library pick a theme and free-associate an hour of music, interviews, and library talk every Friday for lunch. You'll hear indie rock, pop rock, alt rock, New Wave, and the occasional oddity in between interviews with students, faculty, and librarians.  How come they aren't being X-cast to ds106radio? I might have to fix that. This week's show featured an interview with UCLA (my alma mater!) professor Jean-Franois Blanchette (UCLA) talking about the changing nature of discovering personal records on the web. The show revolved around the questions and cahllenges of trying the manage one's digital identity through a series of third party, corporate services that have no real concern for your interests. It also usefully framed the U.S. context ? largely driven by media and advertising interest groups ? to the European stage tht is actually making decisions that enable it's citizens to be forgotten by search engines like Google. Great stuff!  The interview was broken up into a couple of parts, and the music played throughout the show was themed around disappearing. It was really quite brilliantly done. Much of the conversation was deeply relevant to the work we are doing at UMW currently, so it was a total treat when they gave a shout-out to Domain of One's Own.  http://bavatuesdays.com/files/2014/05/LITSEpisode209doooexcerpt.mp3  I have to say I love that Charlie Bennett refers to Domain of One's Own as a movement in higher ed. I;m not sure it has the critical mass of a movement jsut yet, but I think the more and more folks listen to shows like this and realize how essential it is to start engaging and interrogating the issues around who we and who owns us in these digital spaces, the more apparent how necessary a reclamation movement like Domain of One's Own is, or at least I hope on my better days.  "Jim Groom,Installing WordPress Multisite and Using FeedWordPress,http://bavatuesdays.com/installing-wordpress-multisite-and-using-feedwordpress/,5/30/2014,"Yesterday I sat down with UBC Philosophy faculty and ds106 rockstar Christina Hendricks to record a walk-through of how to install and manage WordPress Multisite using the script-installer Installatron. Additionally, we covered the following:     How to manage your multisite account, with a special focus on the level of abstraction from the site to the network    How to export and import a WordPress site    How to use the syndication plugin FeedWordPress  The more I work with faculty and students on managing their own web hosting and domain, the more I am convinced it's not only manageable for just about anyone, but it's near on getting dead simple. This is by no means to suggest Christina isn't tech savvy ? quite the opposite! However, she's represents a demographic of faculty who've been rocking open source applications like WordPress for teaching and leanring on amazing platforms like UBC Blogs or UMW Blogs for a while now. Given that, they've come to the point where they want to start managing some of their own sites, and exploring beyond the confines of these systems. That's awesome because in my mind that's why we started platforms like this in the first palce, so folks would start to move beyond them.  Nonethless, I emphasize some of her sites above because Christina is not planning on exporting and managing all of her numerous course sites on her own domain. Rather, she's bringing in a few sites that make sense to be on her own domain: her blog, her portfolio site, her ds106 tumblr, etc. It's not all or nothing, rather the two systems working brilliantly together, and the above video is a testament to how awesome open publishing platforms like UBC Blogs and UMW Blogs can be when faculty (or students, staff, etc.) can export their work from a university's platform and seamlessly import that work into their own domain. THAT'S PROGRESS, KIDS!  In effect, by setting up her own WordPress multisite she is able to move from the concept of a site to that of a network of sites that she manages and controls. It's weird for me, but I just really wrapped my head around this idea of the personal network while talking to Christina over the last couple of days. The WordPress Multisite network nomenclature gets at the idea that you, by way of your domain, become a multichanneled space for publishing, sharing, syndicating, aggregating, etc. As Andy Rush has noted before, a ""Network of One's Own!"" And that's exactly what Christina is demonstrating in this walk-through.  If you are interested in how to install your own WordPress Multisite (via Installatron, which you can get through Reclaim Hosting ?? ), manage WordPress Multisite, export/import WP, oand/or use FeedWordPress this video might prove very useful. I am hoping Christina and I can get together again and do a few more about managing your own domain and demonstrating that managing your own oiece of a server has never been simpler!  "Jim Groom,Reclaiming Innovation,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaiming-innovation/,6/3/2014,"Click image to go to article  Yesterday the online version of the EDUCAUSE Review article Brian Lamb and I co-authored went live on the web. I'm really blown away by how much time and energy the good folks at EDUCAUSE Review spent on the web presentation. It looks amazing, and I have to acknowledge right up front that ER editor, Teddy Diggs, was nothing short of amazing throughout the entire process. I had a lot of fun writing this article, and it's really rewarding to see it both online and in print. It represents yet another proud moment within an on-going intellectuall (and degenerate) collaboration I've had with Brian for going on eight years.  More selfishly, this article helped me both crystallize and abstract a series of ideas around Domain of One's Own that needed to be generalized beyond UMW. Originally the idea behind this article was to write a piece about Domain of One's Own touting its awesomeness (and it is!). But when I started talking it over with Brian it quickly became apparent that a broader rumination on the state of innovation and technology in higher education would get at some of the deeper underlying issues that Domain of One's Own addresses. What exactly do we mean when we say innovation? What is this disruption we keep talking about? What is the state of innovation in higher ed when it comes to IT infrastructure? How have we fared in terms of providing spaces for our intellectual communiities to explore the possibilities of the the radical ""disruptor"" know as the web? Is empowerment a part of innovation?  The article is an attempt to answer just those questions, and I think it helped me re-focus some of the reasons why I think Domain of One's Own, and the Reclaim Your Domain movement more generally, remains my chosen future. The online piece provides a series of extras, such as clips of a conversation between Brian and I embedded in the article about the process. Also, there are a series of examples of schools like UMW, UBC, and various CUNY colleges that are enacting the values at the heart of building a technological infrastructure for teaching and learning around people. In addition, for the online version I spent many hours alongside Andy Rush interviewing staff, faculty, and students at UMW to explain what exactly Domain of One's Own means to our campus. The following 12 minute video, embedded below, is the result of that exploration.  And if that's not enough, Brian and Jon Fulton were, as luck would have it, able to sit down with both Audrey Watters and Kin Lane at Thompson River University to discuss what exactly this whole ""reclaim"" thing is all about. I think they both lay out a brilliant frame for what this might mean on a personal level.  I'd like to think their vision is complemented by Domain of One's Own at UMW, suggesting that such an ethos can work on several levels: personal, professional, institutional, etc. There's a spectrum to reclaim. It's not a reaction; it's a proactive move to start demanding we have more control over who we are in cyberspace. For UMW, reclaim is about factoring the importance of taking ownership of your information into the work you do not only as a student, but as a citizen.  Brian and I fashioned this piece as a re-visiting of the ""Nevermind the EDUPUNKs"" article we wrote for EDUCAUSE Review in 2010. Four years on I remain confident that empowering individuals to reclaim their work online is not just an idea, but an infrastructure that folks can and will actually work towards impelementing. If we think that teaching and learning in the 21st century needs to deeply interrogate the role of the web in education, and that's becoming readily apparent, then I can't imagine how the vision of the student, faculty, and staff member as various nodes within a broader learning network framed by the course or the unviersity or the world at lerge can't be anything but imminent. Here's to hoping.  "Jim Groom,#tic104: How it Works Guide,http://bavatuesdays.com/tic104-how-it-works-guide/,6/10/2014,"The Internet Course, which I can't stop writing about :), continues to blow me away in thought and deed. This post will focus on a deed done dirt cheap! Last week the course focused on the topic ""How it Works,"" and the idea was that all seven students focus on succinctly and clearly describing how the various technologies that make up the itnernet work. And that's what they did to great effect, and major kudos are due to auditor (that's right, auditor!) Steven Hartzell for running week three so seamlessly. [How many classes are there in which an auditor runs the course for a week? None, that's how many.]  Steven came into week 3 with a clear plan, he broke down how it works into six categories: hardware, protocols, languages, data, networks, and ISPs. We brainstormed what might fall under each category ? you can read more about the process and brainstorming here ? and after some discussion we came up with one more category: software. Each student took one category and based on the brainstorming went off to research their work and popualte the wiki page for week 3 with what they found. We spent much of Tuesday discussing what they found, vetting the sources, and generally deciding on an agreed upon format.  By Wednesday all the research was basically done and Steven kicked in part 2of his plan: the class would code their own resource page in HTML and style it with CSS. Learn how it works by creating it, baby! He guided us through a tutorial on how to write HTML, use a local editor, uploading .html pages and media to publichtml through the file manager on cPanel (did I mention how much I love Domain of One's Own for making this dead simple?), exploring relative links, and generally playing with HTML. It was awesome, the entire class was actively learning how it works, and it was all business because it was directly related to the project at hand. Everyone was required to code the information for the topic they did their research on.  On Thursday we reviewed each person's HTML page to make sure they were working properly. After that, we dug into CSS (which blew me away because I didn't think we could get that far). Steven asked the simple question, ""How do we want out site to look?"" We talked about inline styles, internal stylesheets, external stylesheets, the revoltuion of cascading stylesheets for design, and more. It was a fun discussion, and by the end of two hours everyone created their own local stylesheets thanks to Steven's guidance, at the same time they all agreed on a very minimalist, yet effective, design for their collection of old gold HTML pages discussing how the internet works.  Steven took up the rear with collecting everyone's HTML pages via email, and then making sure the pages linked, the styles were consistent, and the links were realtive and posted it on his site. After that he sent me all the HTML pages, and I uploaded them to a subdirectory on the course site and they all work perfectly. Check out their ""How It Works"" guide custom-made in HTML and CSS lcoally in Fredericskburg, Virginia ?? Did I mention Steven was an auditor? How awesome is he? NOBODY!!!  "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own 2.0: the Manatee Release,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-2-0-the-manatee-release/,6/12/2014,"Domain of One's Own, the distributed, web-based sea cow everyone loves!  In this wopping one hour and 26 minute video Martha Burtis and Tim Owens take you through two years of development on the UMW Domains project. It's the most thorough record available of the work they've been doing since Summer 2012, and it traces the thinking, development, and deployment of how UMW is giving every student, faculty, and staff a domain and web hosting account of their own.  We understand that an hour and 26 minutes is a very long time, so we're breaking down the conversation according to specific topics so you can watch what might be relevant for you:  00:01:26 ? 00:10:30 Domain of One's Own 0.5: The Alpha Pilot  Timeframe: Spring 2012 through Spring 2013  In the first part of the video Tim and Martha discuss the pilot of Domain of One's Own. We start with some history. During the Fall 2012/Spring 2013 Academic year we used a dedicated server with MediaTemple (which uses the hosting control panel software Plesk) and also had them acting as our domain registry system. This method had us adding requested domains to a spreadsheet that we submitted as tickets to MediaTemple. This was how we signed up 420 domains during the pilot, but there was no question there would have to be another way.  00:10:31 ? 00:20:53 Domain of One's Own 1.0: The Godaddy of EDU!  Timeframe: Late Spring 2013 through Fall 2013 (mid-October)  In this segment Tim and Martha narrate the development over the summer of 2013. Having gotten presidential funding to run a Domain of One's Own at UMW for the next four years, the challenge of making this a manageable system that we could deply to upwards of 1000 students, faculty and staff became a bit daunting. We moved to a dedicated server contracted through a state vendor and installed cPanel hosting control panel software as well as WHMCS, the software which enables management of the various shared hosting accounts. In effect, we were making the transition to becoming our own hosting service, and this section narrates the challenegs, opportunities, and limits engineered into the process based on the software we were using. There is also mention of Installatron, a script installer that made much of the earlier work we did around the community site possible.  00:20:53 ? 00:43:30 Domain of One's Own 1.5: Red October  Timeframe: Fall 2013 (mid-October) through Winter 2014    Come Fall 2013 people are signing-up for domains, and we have all sorts of activity but no community. Martha and Tim start building out a prototype for the community site which hooks into Installatron. In turn, we are able to start adding the various sites' feeds with specfic tags and categories to FeedWordPress that would syndicate a representation of the community at large. The work during this period enabled dropdowns for selecting classes, their status, department, etc. We could effectively start adding metadata to a wide range of sites and posts across the university. It was the beginning of pushing this idea of simply being a web hosting solution to actually building a community out of the more than 820+ sites on Domain of One's Own. This development carried over into Spring, and was really crystallized in mid January 2014 as we were all preparing to attend the Domain Incubator in Atlanta which was snowed out twice! This section features developmet like the D]directory of sites, the calendar of posts, statistics, and more elegant design. This generative period was also the beginning of Tim and Martha's exploration of APIs, which changed our lives!  00:43:30 ? 01:19:00 Domain of One's Own 2.0: Manatee  Timeframe: Spring 2014 through Now  Tim and Martha fully realize the possbilities of make this project as simple, elegant and tight as possible. And the results are nothing short of amazing. In this section the discussion centers around some of the ""pain points"" in the workflow of Domain of One's Own up and until now. One of the biggest was the various username/passwords for CPanel and WHMCS, not to mention all the specific applications (like WordPress, etc.) they install as part of their domain. Through enable single sign-on through Central Authentican System (CAS) and some real magic with APIs and FeedWordPress wrangling UMW Domains is truly a fine-tuned domain vending machine without the vending ?? In effect, we are using the Domain of One's Own main WordPress site (http://umw.domains) as dashboard where they can create a domain name, access their cPanel, export all their files, unlock their domain, and manage their various sites, make them public and/or private, add additional sites to their account. etc. It's truly amazing how tightly designed the Domains project has become thanks to the work of Martha and Tim.  01:19:00 ? 01:26:11 Domain of One's Own 3.0?: Let Us Help You   Timeframe: The Future  How can we start sharing the Domain of One's own infrastructure with whomever wants it? Imagining it as a Machine Image we can share on Amazon Web Services tht can be accessed and customized by anyone interested. TIm also discusses how projects like Known start providing us with applications through Domain of One's Own that empower us to push hard on further articulating the raison d'tre for doing this in the first place: reclaiming who we are on the web.  "Jim Groom,8 New Things that Rule about UMW Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/eight-new-things-that-rule-about-umw-domains/,6/13/2014,"I just posted a tour de force video of an hour and 26 minute discussion about two years of development that has brought Domain of One's Own to the brink of international greatness where we find it precariously teetering currently. This post will provide the puff of breath necessary to send it over the edge.  Below are eight new features, and I'm sure I'm missing a few more, about the overhauled Domain of One's Own that Martha Burtis and Tim Owens have been building out over the past month that have me more excited that ever about the future of Domain of One's Own at UMW and beyond.  1. Single Sign-On  First and foremost, we now have UMW Domains integrated with Centralized Authentication Service (CAS) that now enables us to take the various logins for CPanel and the billing anagement software WHMCS (which our community need not see) and fold them into the main campus netid and password. This is huge, the hardest part abotu a project like this is keeping your passwords straight, and we just made this a whole lot easier.  2. Integrated CPanel  When you login to UMW Domains, the first thing someone will see is the personalized CPanel for managing their web hosting account. BAM! This is being pulled in through and iframe based on some Tim Owens magic, and we aren't sending users away from the UMW Domains site, they're doing all their work from one space. The idea of coherence matters, and these first two steps are a huge boon to making our community's experience a seamless, user-friendly one.  Tim and Martha have engineered the environment like we never have been able to do before, and it's so cool to think we are at the stage of actually making this tightly integrated. We've been using duct tape for so long it almost feels strange ??  3. Integrated Management of Domains and Backups  Another element that build on the tighter intergration of features in Domain fo One's own is the ways in which your dashboard lists your domains, the relevant registration and renewal dats, as well as provided contextual support about what an EPP code is and how you use it to move your domain. In effect, Tim used the WHMCS API to pull that information into the user's Dashboard on Domain of One's Own.  Same goes for backups, through the CPanel API Tim allows anyone to get a full- backup fo their entire account with one click. We truly want folks to own and seamlessly take their work with them. Next steps is allowing them to send it to Amazon S3, DropBox, etc.  4. Contextualized Support  One of the things you can see in the screenshot below is a series of tabs alonside the Domains and Backups account information that contextually provide support for students, faculty, and staff that want unlock and transfer their domains.  5. Distributed Documentation  Building on the last point, we're including that contextualized documentation through a transclusion plugin for DocuWiki developed by students in Karen Anewalt's Software Engineering course. So, not only do we have all the docuemntation authored in a centralized wiki, but we can contextually include it whereever we want in the Domain of One's Own dashboard.  6. Ability to View Your Content  One of the rad new features Martha developed is the ability to view all of a person's domains, sites and recent posts in one place. What's more, if you are logged in your dashboard, you wills ee tabs for managing your content and add new sites. More on that in points 7 and 8.  7. Ability to Manage Your Content  One of the things we struggled with during year one of UWM Domains is reconciling the rhetoric of reclaiming your work and owning it with making everything syndicate into the main site. This the latest version, our community members can decided which sites are public and which are private. What's more, they can decide which site syndicates where in terms of courses. For example, if a student has selected The Internet Course when created a blog and now wants to use that blog for a new course, they simple head to manage content and change the course they want to associate their site with. This is so groovy!  8. Ability to Add New Content  But that's not all! With the Add Content tab, people can add any site on the web with a working feed and assocaite it with a class. This includes targeted feeds off of categories or tags. I lvoe this feature because it effectively open up the Domain of One's Own community to any site that person uses to publish on the web, as long as it has a working RSS feed. EDUGLU anyone?

"Jim Groom,Where Reclaim's Going,http://bavatuesdays.com/where-reclaims-going/,6/18/2014,"Image Credit: ""Keep on Reclaimig"" by Alan Levine  More than a year ago the idea of ""reclaiming the web"" started to congeal for me as a result of the MIT Hackathon I attended. It's there where Audrey Watters and Kin Lane plugged me into the future of the web. During that two day stint we imagined a project called Reclaim Your Domain that we've been working on in those rare few available moments since. Professionally, reclaiming is all about trying to educate people about how the web works and empower then to take control of their small piece of it. Politically it's about consciously resisting the increasing centralization of everything to a few online corporate conglomerates. I believe the one makes the other possible.  Reclaim has been the intellectual basis of much of the work I've been part of since, and even prior, it just didn't have that title yet. UMW went live with Domain of One's Own this past Fall, and that's a project that has empowering students, staff, and faculty to interrogate how the web works built into its DNA. A year ago Tim Owens and I started Reclaim Hosting, and that has been a means of providing an infrastructure for folks to experiment with managing their space on the open web for a pittance with unparalled support. As Audrey so brilliantly frames it, ""The Future of Ed-Tech is a Reclamation Project."" Her willed optimimism is the hallmark of generous and generative humanity and reinforces for me that this is my future as well.  But the cool part of all this that I am starting to realize is that we're not alone in the push to reclaim. Just the other day Doug Belshaw started drawing the contours of this broader movement in his post on the DML Hub titled ""Reclaiming the Web for the Next Generation."" He connects the recent global realizations that a) we're all being surveilled online by at least the NSA, but probably many, mnay more agencies; b) our personal data is the currency for the predominant ""free"" online business models, and privacy is the cost; and c) we can't solve this alone, we need to start re-thinking our relationship to the web as a connected culture. This post really starts to frame why reclaiming one's sense of their own domain (to verbally mashup the work I'm part of) has far broader implications than an initaitive at UMW or a few hippies trying to explain web hosting.  In fact, on the same day I saw Belshaw's post, I also read Jon Udell's ""Mapping the Decentralization Movement"", which is another articulation of the mobilization, as Udell notes, to ""re-decentralize"" the web. The project Udell is currently work on, Thali, is an experiment to see what a truly peer-to-peer web might look like. But he notes it is just one of many projects like this. He links to a long list of people and projects that are trying to make this alternative web a reality, and it's a great palce to start getting sense of what may prove to be a broader cultural movement away from the centralization of the web.  In fact, UMW's DTLT recently talked with Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey who are leading up Known ? one of the projects on that list ? about how their software might enable our community to publish to a variety of different services without ever having to login to them. A personal hub for pushing content to these other services, while at the same time claiming the work you are creating locally and decided where you want to share and how. Tim Owens has been experimenting with this software, and I think he may already have it as one-click install for the folks on both UMW's Domain of One's Own and Reclaim Hosting.  And that, for me, is where Reclaim Hosting is going. We want to support as many people as possible explore as many of these applications that enable them to more easily manage and control their piece of the web. We'll be working our way through the alterative web community's applications and see if we can make them part of the Reclaim Hosting application universe. Even better, we hope to be contributing to at least one more as part of the Reclaim Your Domain project, but more on that anon. And start addressing all those applications that can't run in a LAMP environment, we're currently working on helping people install and manage applications that run on a particular set of dependencies in a virtualized environment. We'll be making a push to explore machine images for a variety of applications and document how to get them working. But more importantly, we're working on a rollout of the community- focused face of Reclaim Hosting that will provide a space to share the work happening by interersted parties from across the Reclaim universe.  To this end, as you might have surmised, Reclaim Hosting is not a pilot anymore. We're bonafide! We plan on sticking around to support reclaimers for a long time. We just redesigned the site, integrated CPanel into the client area, and updated our pricing model. Rolling out the next stage of Reclaim Hosting is exciting because it truly feels we are part of a broader movement to help people start thinking about the importance of re-decentralizing the web. And I remain convinced the best way at this is to start by taking control of your own little piece of it.  "Jim Groom,UMW Domains vs UMW Blogs,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-vs-umw-blogs/,6/23/2014,"There's a somewhat manufactured rivalry in the DTLT bullpen between the old gold blogging platform UMW Blogs and the young upstart UMW Domains. Ryan and I stand on the side of tried and true tradition, while Tim and Martha are into the new and shiny. Andy is still waiting for both to come out in HD ??  The rivalry is mostly imagined because we all see the value and need for both, and the fact that one developed out the other illustrates the spectrum of thought these approaches represent. Domain of One's Own is, as I've said before, the apotheosis of UMW Blogs. With UWM Domains anyone can run their own UMW Blogs system if they wanted. That's the real push behinds domains, it enables an entire campus community to take control of their own innovation toolkit.  THinking through this yesterday, I wanted to see how the first year of UMW Domains might have effected the traffic on UMW Blogs. I understand this is cursory, and one day when I get smarter I'll do more with all the data we've accumulated. But for now, I am just looking at aggregates such as page views, unique users and sessions (the new terminology for visitors). And looking at these numbers, I'm wondering if UMW Domains might have had an effect on UMW Blogs' page views.  Last year, from May 2012 through June 2013, UMW Blogs had 4.6 million page views, from 1.8 million uniques users spread out amongst 2.4 million sessions.  This year, from June 2013 through June 2014, both unique users and sessions were just a bit higher with 1.9 millions users and 2.41 million sessions. Pageviews, on the other hand, went down 500,000 to 4 million. It's interesting that UMW Blogs traffic remained relatively steady, regardless of the fact that we had almost 800 sites running on UMW Domains this year, and moere than 20 of those were courses.  It would be interesting to try and get a sense of the traffic statistics across UMW Domains to do a comparison, but that might be impossible given how distributed Domain of One's own is by design. While we can easily capture the number of posts and broader activity that syndicates in from the community hub, an aggregate traffic report along the lines of UMW Blogs would be almsot impossible toget given there is no centralized site of activity. Everythign is decentralized to the level of the individual user.  That said, there are so many other things with UMW Domains we can begin to measure, and thanks to Martha you can see them on the stats page. We can measure sites by deartment, sites by software, sites by status (i.e. faculty, student, staff, etc.), and posts by date. One of the things that will be interesting as UMW Domains continues to grow is how we can start to understand how this ecosystem is about a different set of aggregates than pageviews, unique users, and sessions.  I believe that UMW Domains will begin to suggest an ecosystem that starts moving us beyond the predefined axis of the course, and starts making our entire community start to think of their spaces online as their personalized network wherein they interact online. UMW Blogs and UMW Domains are both simply steps ina continuum along these lines, providing structure and a sense of why go about imaginign this space with the certainty that this will matter in the future. Who we are is heavily mediated, and we need to start understanding what involved in becoming a citizen in such an encirnment meeans.  "Jim Groom,A New Wave of Open,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-new-wave-of-open/,7/2/2014,"David Wiley rules for many reasons, but one that I want to point out in this post which was inspired by his most recent post is how well he distills how empowering students and faculty to truly own their work online can radically change the way we think about publishing more broadly. He understands the value and focus of the learning management system for so many, and uses that as the example wherein using the POSSE model (or publishing on your own site an syndicating elswhwere) can start to change the way we imagine these systems. The LMS as a syndication hub, not a vertically integrated destination for all our learning needs.  > The question immediately arises ? when will we be able to POSSE into our formal learning environments? Could it be done today? For example, could we write a Known plugin that would let us POSSE into Canvas? Knowing what I do of their API, I think we could.  >  > How would that change students' relationships with their courses and institutions? Maybe this is already where the Reclaim folks are going, and I'm only just catching up, but give each student (1) their own domain, (2) a Known install, and (3) the ability to POSSE into the LMS ? and just think about the implications. What does ""submitting"" homework mean now? What does an e-portfolio mean now? How do assessments need to change when there are worked examples of assignments everywhere? And where was I ever going to point the Evidence metadata in an open badge before students had this?  Here at UMW Tim Owens and Martha Burtis have already been experimenting with Canvas's API over the last few months, and what David is suggesting in his post is right inlien with what we've been imagining. And we could do something like what he's imagining here in the very near future. We're a Canvas school, and we would love to start pushing hard on some of these frontiers alongside others to see how Domain of One's Own and Canvas integrate more cleanly for this kind of ""reclaim personal publishing"" approach.  Like David, I am really excited for what I imagine as a new wave of open that actually positions that term in direct relationship between the person publishing online and the work they produce within a variety of personal, social, and institutional settings. Open as in control is interesting to me because it takes these two ideas that have been imagined as diametrical opposites in regards to the LMS, and pits them in a seemingly natural juxtaposition when it comes to owning your work.  What's happenign more broadly right now is folks all over the world are re- thinking this very question of control when it comes to their own work. The move to re-decentralize the web is afoot, and it makes sense we start digging into the implciations for higher ed of this emergent online consciousness of the value of having some control over one's own digital trace. What if open is focused on being able to manage your contexts and share outside of pre- determined commerical structures? I'm really excited to see where Wiley takes his exploration of ""the relationship between POSSE and ïopen'"" in a future post. It's time he reclaimed open, if you will ??  "Jim Groom,The Stump Speech for Higher Ed's Relevance that Wasn't,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-stump-speech-for-higher-eds-relevance-that-wasnt/,7/13/2014,"Image source: 1859  I already wrote a bit about my experience at the symposium for Framing the Future of Higher Education I attended on Friday in Austin, Texas. I was part of an opening discussion around the changing role of faculty in the future of higher education. While I am not a professor, the work I did with ds106 has suggested to many that I might be some demented, cyborgian vision of what's to come. I can only hope they're wrong.  I really liked the format of the conversational featured session, and it was a pleasure responding to Sally Johnstone's ideas. The plan was to have a quick 8-10 minute intro where we talk about our vision of the future of higher ed. As an exercise I wrote up my position, and for a minute I though I might use it. But I abandoned it at the last moment because it didn't feel right. I ended up talking specifically about what UMW's doing with Domain of One's Own, and the vision of a community inspired to interrogate the digital landscape as part of a broader interdisciplinary approach to the liberal arts.  I'm including what I wrote up for the initial speech below with hopes I might come back to it and make it better (or someone out there will ?? ). It's too preachy and not nuanced enough on the issues of cost, privilege, and ackowledging and exploring the wide-range of alternatives on the landscape. That said, the idea that higher ed (not vocational training and certification) at it's heart should be a place that cultivates alternative ways of imagining the world we live in would not get cut. I truly believe it should be a place of stark critique, creative possibilities, and boundless hope, but that's probably why I am ever more useless going forward. My ideals and the reality couldn't be more divergent in the aggregate. I'm trying to be honest with myself on that count, but it still hurts.  > What's the role of higher education?  >  > This is a question we could probably dedicate a series of conferences to, and I'm well aware it's a far broader question than we can cover in this discussion. But it's an important anchor for my position within this discussion. I think the role of higher ed is not just to teach and certify students, but also challenge some of our most sacred cultural assumptions.  >  > The discussion around access to an education is often limited to the political keywords of lowers costs and equal opportunity, and while they're both crucial, there's a third element of access associated with the university that's eroding: access to truly alternative ways of thinking. An educated community that is given the freedom and power to critique who we are and what we do. I would argue it's not only crucial for students to have access to these ideas, but also for our culture at large.  >  > [Aside: a large part of this erosion is brought on by the tenured class of academics themselves?welcoming in a wave of adjunct labor to work for a fraction of the cost that often enabled less teaching and more freedom, but without any mind to the longterm implications of this reality. ]  >  > We've become increasingly polarized as a nation when it comes to politics (#theteaparty), religion (#hobbylobby), and wealth (#occupy), and there's little question anymore, at least legally, that corporations are increasingly the people we aspire to be. But for me, and I can only speak for myself in this, education provided a space for us to move beyond these extremes. A space to cultivate a more nuanced, historicized understanding of the ideas that shape who we are as a society. A meta-level of cognition to begin to think about how we think, a space to commune with people who have spent a lifetime thinking about thinking.  >  > Now don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting this is the only model for learning or becoming accredited or qualified, but rather a moment wherein we are all encouraged to dig deeply and critically into who we are, a historical context for the moment we exist in, and an interrogation of the prejudices and promises of our cultural moment. That requires both agency and academic freedom. It requires funding and protections. It requires time for both faculty and students. And, ultimately, it requires an investment in higher education as a perceived need for the health of our culture. Given the tale of state funding for higher education across the US over the last thirty years, one could easily argue that has not been a percieved need by anyone in power for a long while.  >  > That said, one of the reasons we are here today is to talk about the fact that skyrocketing college costs aren't necessarily equated with better quality ? and better compensated ? faculty. According to the article in The Atlantic, ""The Ever Shrinking role of Tenured College Professors,"" since 1975 the number of full-time tenured and tenure-track professors have gone from roughly 45 percent of all teaching staff to less than a quarter. What's more, the reverse is true for adjunct faculty. The number of part-time faculty has gone from less than 25% of all faculty in 1975 to more than 40% in 2011.  >  > That's the story, and one of my roles in this is to imagine how ed-tech can honor the mission of access to alternative ideas while at the same time navigate the shark-laden waters of the politics of defunding higher education. It's a tricky game, especially for an ed-tech like me from a public liberal arts college in Virginia who palys a professor on TV. That said, I am not without ideasƒ.and hopefully I'll hit on a few of them during our discussion today.  "Jim Groom,Connected Courses,http://bavatuesdays.com/connected-courses/,8/1/2014,"It's been a long while since I posted on the bavablog, but I have a few good reasons as to why. I'll be blogging about each of them over the next week or so (I'm back in the blog game!), but let me start with the first reason of many: Connected Courses. The official announcement will be coming will becoming next week, but I have been promising Howard Rheingold, my co- conspirator in this experiment, a post trying to explain what the hell Connected Courses is for some time now. I have failed at my charge thus far, but he's a hippie so hope springs eternal for him ??  Connected Courses Crew at UC Irvine for Course Design BootcampBelow is my peripatetic attempt to explain Connected Courses, which I'll be a part of alongside an amazing cadre of educators that I'll do my best to namecheck after I take a stab at a description. But one more thing before that, the road towards designing Connected Courses consisted of six months of planning, numerous calls, and a three day intensive bootcamp at UC Irvine that took place two weeks ago. I'll try to write more about the details of that experience, but I think framing the road to perdition might help contextualize what's to follow. Now let me try and explain the genesis and raison d'etre for Connected Courses and what shape it may be taking over the Fall 2014 semester.  After being interviewed by Howard Rheingold for a Digital Media & Learning (DML) video about connected learning last summer, he somehow caught the ds106 bug. As some of you fine readers may know, it's a very dangerous condition. The ds106 bug occurs when you get exposed to the awesome community that undergirds the digital storytelling course that started ? and is still happening ? at the University of Mary Washington (UMW). As a result of this infection, Howard wanted to explore how we might get DML to help provide some resources for getting educators exposed and interested in possibilities for creating a similar course. As we started to think about it, we imagined a series of web-based resources that would help interested educators get up and running with their own domain and web hosting so they could explore the various options available to them with such a powerful open source toolbox. This was modeled on what we do with participants in ds106 as well as an initiative we're running out of UMW called Domain of One's Own ? which Howard and I explored in depth this Fall with a three-part video series dedicated to demosntrating how we built the aggregated hub for his Stanford course.  When Howard went to Mimi Ito with the idea, she not only dug it, she wanted more. Her idea was to try and bring together a group of educators who have taught courses that embody the principles of connected learning and the values of the open web. Some examples of such courses are Alec Courosïs ETMOOC, Jonathan Worthïs Phonar, Anne Balsamoïs cooperative FemTechNet, the National Writing Project's CLMOOC, and Gardner Campbellïs Thought Vectors to name just a few. In fact, as part of DML's Reclaim Open Learning Symposium last Fall, a few of these courses were recognized for their respective approaches to open, web-based teaching and learning.  > Our goal is to build an inclusive and expansive network of teachers, students, and educational offerings that makes high quality, meaningful, and socially connected learning available to everyone.  So, as timing and luck would have it, we were able to bring folks from each of these courses to UC Irvine two weeks ago to spend an intensive three days designing an open, online course that will be launching in September. The idea is relatively simple, we'll be providing a framework and support for educators who want to explore what it means to teach a connected course. The dream is that it becomes a broader, inclusive community that fosters and supports ongoing collaboration and exploration.  The course will be broken down into seven major parts, and they will happen from September 2nd through the middle of December. It will cover a wide swath of topics related to connected learning.  Sept 2 -Move-in/Orientation: The first two weeks are being consider a pre-course orientation. I'll be working with Alan Levine and Howard Rheingold to get any interested faculty their own domain and web hosting. We will provide support for folks who want to get their own domain up and running, as well as an overview of what's possible in such a space.  September 17th ? Why We Need a Why?: The course officially starts with the why. What is, or should be, the future of higher education? What do we stand to lose or gain in pursuing the possibilities opened up by the Web? What are the underlying logics and effects of different approaches to teaching with technology/online? This two week unit will be led by Michael Wesch, Mimi Ito, and Helen Keegan.  September 29th ? Trust and Network Fluency: This unit will be led by Jonathan Worth and Kira Baker-Doyle, and they will explore a range of questions including: In the quantum learning space where interest is a key driver, how do we employ the same dynamics in our teaching? How do we maintain trust and a sense of security in open networks? How do we build our networks? How do we enable at-large learners to engage in our courses? Where should we teach our classes?  October 13th ? The World Wide Web: From Concept to Platform to Cultures: Gardner Campbell, Kim Jaxon, Chris Mattia, Howard Rheingold, and Laura Hilliger will lead an exploration of the web, exploring the following issues: What is this thing called the World Wide Web? What are the values and ambitions that gave rise to its design? If ""the medium is the message,"" what is the message of the web? What are some threshold concepts that help us to understand what is meant by ""the web""? How is it reframing learning and education?  October 27th ?  Diversity, Equity, Access: Facilitators Lisa Nakamura, Anne Balsamo, Liz Losh and Veronica Paredes will examine the assertion that wisdom is created through discussions over differences. This unit will explore the implications of race, gender, and sexuality on networked culture by employing a feminist pedagogy that demonstrates a praxis of networking and mentoring.  November 10th ? About Co-learning: Facilitators Howard Rheingold, Mia Zamora,and Alec Couros will explore how self empowerment emerges within classrooms that embrace co-learning. And by extension, how networked learning contributes to self empowerment as students take more charge of their own learning outcomes and share their interest-driven knowledge. This unit will explore how this pedagogy differs from traditional methods of teaching & learning? As well as how instructors can support a co-learning environment?  December 1st ? Putting it all into practice: Planning the connected course: For the final unit I'll be joined by Lisa M. Lane, Jaime Hannans, Jaimie Hoffman, Mikhail Gershovich, and Alan Levine to help people focus on practical issues like building their course site, creating a syndicated site, digging into specific issues that arise when teaching an open online class, reflections on previous weeks' activities, as well as feedback on specific assignments and projects while building a connected course. Like the orientation week, this will be on the ground support and feedback to help faculty practically employ some of the ideas explored on their own technical platform.  It's a pretty intense cast of characters that will be providing a fourteen week, top-notch professional development opportunity for anyone who wants to explore the various technical, social, and cultural implications of teaching on and through the web. I'm working on coupling this experience with a focused cohort on the ground here at UMW. And I am aware of several others campuses that are doing the same thing. The idea is to get faculty up and running with their own space so that they can explore the web as a portal to imagining possibilities for their own courses. The various topics over the course will allow folks to dip in and interrogate a variety of issues they're interested in, yet the experience starts with a technical primer on setting up your domain and webhosting and is bookended with specific, practical applications that provides hands-on technical guidance and course design feedback to help anyone interested design their own connected course.  I think that's pretty cool, using the a connected course to scale connected courses, it's very reflexive ?? The site and registration will be up and running next Friday, so consider this long, meandering post a preview, if you even made it this far.    In fact, that event was born out of the DML sponsored Reclaim Open Hackathon that gave birth to the Reclaim Your Domain work I've been part of this past year, which is gaining some momentum and a broader community thanks to the recent Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in LA.  "Jim Groom,I'm a Reclaimer Now,http://bavatuesdays.com/im-a-reclaimer-now/,8/3/2014,"Imae Credit: Kin Lane's Reclaiming Fist  The work I've been part of with Domain of One's Own encouraging faculty and students to get their own domain and web hosting has a pretty long history that pre-dates my time at UMW. Almost twelve years ago now, my friend Zach Davis turned me on to the world of commodity web hosting. He spun up a server and encouraged me ? and a bunch of his friend around the country ? to get a domain. What's more, he helped us point those domains to his server and gave a bunch of us cPanel accounts so we could actually use it. He created a hosting co-operative, similar to what Tim Owens did with Hippie Hosting two years ago, and what we're doing together with Reclaim Hosting. I had no idea how important that offer of a domain and web hosting would be to my career more than a decade later.  When I talk about web hosting in regards to a platform for understanding of how the web works, I speak from experience. The technical stuff has never been intuitive for me, I've spent a lot of time trying to grok how domains, servers, code, databases, etc. work together to make the web. I'm still struggling with that, and the work with WordPress and other open source applications on a LAMP server stack has proven invaluable for wrapping my head around this stuff.  So, why the nostaglic look back in time? Because for near on twleve years I have remained hosted with Zach. I spent years on the hosting co-operative he started, and then moved with him to Cast Iron Codingïs servers, which is his successful Portland-based business. He's provided a home on his servers for all my web work, not to mention ongoing advice and support for my experiments with WordPress over the years. Zach's been a huge influence and inspiration for the work I've done up and until now, and while he's ready to kick my ass out the door of Cast Iron Coding's servers ? I'm a little sad to go. I consider myself a loyal person.  That said, I guess it was high time I move all my web stuff to the bitchin' hosting company that I'm helping to run. Tim Owens has Reclaim Hosting running like a top, and with the new backup system ? just to name one recent feature ? I'd be crazy not to move. I see the role of Reclaim Hosting as similar to what Zach did for many of us back in the early oughts, we're providing as many faculty and students as possible with a hands-on platform for understanding of how the web works.  I'm now officially a reclaimer, and all my domains are finally off Godaddy. It's almost like I am getting my digital life in order, and it feels pretty damn good!    Zach also turned me onto instructional technology while I was at CUNY, and introduced me to Downes's the OL Daily.  "Jim Groom,"OpenVA 2.0: October 18th, 2014",http://bavatuesdays.com/openva-2-0-october-18th-2014/,8/12/2014,"Below is the text of an email I recently sent out to all of the attendees at last year's inaugural OpenVA conference. As the following email notes, this year we are doing things a bit different, focusing more intently on how we utilize out time together to build some momentum around getting some things done. It seems to have resonated with folks because we already have 75+ registrants in less than two weeks, and most folks on that email list are still enjoying the precious last moments of summer vacation. Read on for more details and be sure to register before we cap out at 150.    Image Credit: EdCamp Fort Wayne  WE'RE BACK!!!  This Fall we are running a 2nd Annual OpenVA conference, but we have decided to change up the format a bit. As you may recall, the inaugural event held last October at the University of Mary Washington was a conference format that brought together educators, learning technology specialists and administrators to share innovative practices using open education resources. Since that time, the planning committee has remained engaged and they are enthusiastic about furthering the work in this area.  We have scheduled a follow-up event, to be held at Tidewater Community College on Saturday, October 18th. The event is free and open to all, and will focus on a relatively small number of existing projects in and around Virginia that feature how various universities are utilizing open content, infrastructure, and pedagogy to garner both grassroots and institutional support for sharing open resources and to promote institutional collaboration. Some specific projects include Tidewater Community College's ""Z-Degree"" focused on affordable textbooks, University of Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own created to empower students and faculty to manage their digital lives, as well as looking at how various institutions are rethinking IT infrastructure in light of cloud computing. And that's just a few of the projects and topics  What's more, we want your projects too! We are interested in other innovative higher ed projects exploring open educational resources, open infrastructure, or open pedagogy happening around the state. Submit your example using the following link, and the committee will reach out for more details: http://openva.org/innovation/  This Summit on Building Open VA will features examples as well as gather input from participants during four focused discussion sessions with the purpose of developing recommendations for a statewide open resource strategy.  Please help in the promotion of this event among your colleagues. We wish to attract faculty, administrators, legislators, librarians and learning technologists,     who have put together successful individual initiatives that they would like to expand or scale    who know, or want to know, how to support an Open educational initiative,    who understand the importance of an Open Initiative and want to get a better understanding of how ïOpen' is currently being deployed throughout Virginia,    who believe in the promise of ïOpen' but don't know where to get started or how to sustain an open initiative once it gets started,    who want to learn how to form and write policy for open education.  Some event presenters will be invited by the planning committee based on its prior knowledge of their work and its relevance to the topics. However, there is also an open call on the website for submissions so that the committee can learn about other examples and incorporate them into a robust schedule for the day.  The event website is: http://openva.org/  Also, you can register for the event, which will be free of charge, here: http://openva.org/register-2/  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks for your attention,  Jim Groom    If you want to end any further emails about OpenVA, send me an email and let me know. You can respond to this email or send a note to jimgroom@gmail.com.  "Jim Groom,Blogging from Behind,http://bavatuesdays.com/blogging-from-behind/,8/14/2014,"The title says it all, I've been blogging from behind lately. Ever since I hit the road for a lion's share of July to Austin, Los Angeles, and Norman, Oklahoma I've been feeling the pressure to catch up. It's often a good pressure, and I write on this blog for my own professional and personal sanity ? it's been a failure, I know.  Despite my best intentions, sometimes there just isn't enough time. I've been involved in a wide range of projects that I'm really excited about: Connected Courses, Reclaim Your Domain, OpenVA, and Reclaim Hosting. And my travel this summer was dedicated to three out of the four listed. Catching up on this blog would mean writing the awesome Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in LA (although a few others far smarter than me already have so I should just relax and link). Starting to share the work we're doing with Connected Courses to try and model and mentor teachers that want to explore designing an open, connected course this fall. Breaking down the Reclaim Hosting explosion that's happened this summer with schools like the University of Oklahoma, CSU Channel Islands, Emory University, Southern Polytechnic State University, and Davidson College exploring Domain pilots. Exciting times!  And then there's my day job where we're pushing out Domain of One's Own to the entire campus, souping up UMW Blogs by moving the database to Amazon Web Hosting, and settling into an awesome new building ? the Information and Technology Convergence Center ?  which features some pretty kickass DTLT offices. In fact, much of this semester will be devoted getting used to a whole new cutting edge space to experiment with teaching and learning technologies.  Andrew Forgrave's #wire106 Poster  And to that end, I'll be co-teaching two classes with Paul Bond this fall. An online ds106 course at UMW that will be themed around David Simon's TV series The Wire (read more about #wire106). Something else I'll be exploring with this edition of ds106 (thanks to Tim Owens, Erin Richey and Ben Werdmuller) is teaching a course without WordPress for the first time in almost a decade!  We'll also be re-visiting The Internet Course this semester. What's cool about that course is I think we are ready to open it up, but in this instance students will be producing the course resources and sharing them openly online. So, rather than faculty focused videos on a specific topic, this experience will focus on the collaborative creation of curriculum and sharing what we've learned openly as teaching. I'm excited about this because it's where my collaborations with Paul have been leading these last two years, and I'm pretty excited to see how this evolves.  So, that's a bit of context for why I am a bit buried here, but the good news is the travel this semester will be extremely light. I've all but shut it down, and I'm truly thrilled that I don't have a plane ride in my future for near on six months.  "Jim Groom,Teaching Without WordPress: Exploring the Known World,http://bavatuesdays.com/teaching-without-wordpress-exploring-the-known-world/,8/15/2014,"During our trip to Norman, Oklahoma to visit a bunch of tuned in and turned on Sooners (more on that trip soon) Tim and I were excitedly talking about our time in LA at the Reclaim Your Domain hackathon. One of the things the many things that came out of the hackathon for me was experimenting with the open source application Known. It's being developed by Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey, and they were at the hackathon exploring how they might use this tool in education. Turns out much of the ethos around Reclaim Your Domain (own our content, take control of your online self, interrogate the web) gels neatly with the tenets undergirding IndieWebCamp.  A couple of things I like about Known:  POSSE: It instantiates many of the principals at the heart of Domain of One's Own, particularly the IndieWeb Camp acronym POSSE ?Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. What's push, it's push rather than pull so it can begin to get at the idea of accessing the APIs of various social media silos like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc. and pushing out to them while controlling the original.  It's Not WordPress: I mean this with the utmost affection. I love WordPress, and it could even be argued UMW has pushed harder than any other institution out there on its promise and possibilities for teaching and learning. In fact, we still do. But one of the things we realized when starting up Domain of One's Own is that WordPress has become too central to our thinking ? risking myopia. We owe it to ourselves to experiment with other tools and technologies.  A Distributed, Open Source Tumblr: One of the things that appealed to me immediately about Known is the simple, Tumblresque interface. Various content types, lightweight admin bar, frontend publishing, and a minimalist aesthetic. It's everything I have learned to love about Tumblr, with the bonus of being open source and designed to capture a distributed network.  Distributed Comments: Thanks to the developers in and around the IndieWeb movement, a nut we've been trying to crack with WordPress aggregation ? syndicating comments ? has been elegantly dealt with thanks to the Web Mentions protocol. A crucial element for connecting distributed communities is baked into applications like Known, which represent a whole new wave of web application.  In on the Groundfloor: Known is both clean and robust, and for a new application it's extremely usable. This means we (Tim, myself, 60+ UMW students, and anyone else out there who wants to experiment) have the unique opportunity to team up with Ben and Erin to see if we can design the next generation edtech syndication hub.  We're going live with Known for ds106 and tic104 this Fall, and I couldn't be more excited to return to experimental mode. We needed it, and thanks to Tim, ben and Erin, we got it in spades. Jazzercise, bitches!  "Jim Groom,Pushing the Known Syndication Hub Beyond RSS,http://bavatuesdays.com/15550/,8/25/2014,"Born of the brainstorming conversation Tim Owens and I had on our way to Oklahoma last month, the push-based syndication hub using with Known for Wire106 has come to pass. It's pretty exciting, and it marks a welcome departure from the hacky hacking that has undergirded all the RSS work we've done at UMW with FeedWordPress for over six years now.  When I went to visit Brian Lamb in Kamloops in December of 2012, I lamented how RSS syndication on UWM Blogs and the then pilot of UMW Domains was increasingly becoming untenable to scale across campus ? everything was a hack. We needed a better way to syndicate the various posts/media we're creating in courses ? and it needed to be a lot easier for faculty and students alike.  But it wouldn't be until April of 2013 when I hung out with Audrey Watters and Kin Lane that I got a glimpse of what an alternative future to RSS might look like: push-based APIs! The foundation for Reclaim Your Domain was laid, and over the next fifteen months it's been driving much of what I've been doing at UMW and beyond: the Internet Course, Reclaim Hosting, OpenVA, etc. It's now come full circle back to the internet's first feral web course: ds106.  This semester we'll be experimenting with a course hub built around the open source application Known (although everything will also be feeding into ds106.us via RSS as well). I've already referred to Known as an open, distributed Tumblr, and that's pretty apt. The minimalism and focus on publishing content quickly and easily makes it very compelling. What's more, developers and co-founders Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey have been more than willing to help us realize a syndication model with Known that we can experiment with for this semester's wire106.  The idea at the heart of the whole thing is actually pretty simple. And the more I think about it, the more it's apparent that Known ? or something a lot like it ? was the application Audrey, Kin, and I were imagining when we hatched Reclaim Your Domain. The following screenshots of the on-boarding/publishing process might reinforce that.  Known allows you to publish status updates, photos, posts, audio files, videos, etc., through your own space and push them to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc. You hook into these site's APIs, and rather than RSS, you are directly posting to these services as well as to your own database for the ""primary"" version. That's the ""own your own data"" and ""push it to the social media siloes""element of this equation.  Add to that a syndication hub and reader and you now have yourself an application that technically instantiates the ethos of Domain of One's Own and the ease of UMW Blogs at once, in the context of a specific, streamlined course space. Let me take you through the sign-up on UMW Domains for wire106 just to give you a sense of how this might look.  Custom wire106 Known package in Domain of One's Own  Once students get a domain and web hosting for wire106, they will already have setup a WordPress blog (more on the integration between WordPress and Known in another post). During week 2, they will be asked to setup their Known site. As you can see from the image above, Tim Owens has made a course specific instance on UMW Domains through Installatron that automatically connects the students' Known instances with the wire106 Known hub. The hub is a centralized Known site that will provide a seamless authentication process for the various social media and blog APIs the class has already set up and will integrate with Known.  Known in Installatron  As you might infer, this is one of the sick parts of having UMW Domains happening. We can roll something like this out in moments. What's more, we can customize Known hubs like this for any interested faculty on campus. This not only provides us a space for experimenting, but it can scale very quickly for the entire campus if need be. I'm not sure the edtech field has woken up to just how powerful having a platform like UMW Domains can be. They're still chasing their tail at Davos in the Desert.  Installing Known in a subdirectory (or subdomain) on UMW Domains  Once it's installed, you can click on the main URL.  The following splash page gets you started setting up Known, and from here it's pretty remarkable how slick the setup is.  You fill out a profile, add an image, your name, brief bio, and URL.  After that, you are given links to four different social media sites: Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, and SoundCloud. What's amazing is how simple they are to authenticate via OAuth. After that, everything you do on the Known site can be sent to any of these sites.  And finally, here is the interface you see after you've on-boarded. The icons are for posting updates, photos, posts, audio, etc.  Now, the #wire106 specific Known will have a ""Wire 106 Hub"" button underneath the status update so students can send it to any combination of Twitter, Facebook, and the wire 106 hub, or none of them.  And, like a good push-based technology, that update syndicates to the Wire106 hub immediately. And without any RSS herding, discovery, or pulling. It's a brave new world.  Now, it's great to have a syndication hub, but even better would be a Tumblr- like reader built-in collecting everything folks have posted for the class, preferably broken down by photos, updates, posts, etc. That's what Ben and Erin are working on for this week, and below is a mock-up:  I have to note that Ben and Erin have been amazing working with us to explore what's possible. They've been getting these features developed seemingly overnight. What's more, Tim has been testing and packaging them up for UMW Domains just as fast as they can send them. It's so cool to see what we've been waiting for for years in terms of clean and easy course syndication come together in days. And, as usual, amazing faculty at UMW like Zach Whalen have already gotten wind and are ready to take the leap this semester. This is going to be fun. We're instructional technologists, this is the job. Let's do it.  "Jim Groom,Visions of Known,http://bavatuesdays.com/visions-of-known/,9/2/2014,"Image credit: I think Audrey Watters took the shot but I grabbed it from Kin's blog  A year and a half ago now, I caught up with Audrey Watters and Kin Lane at the Reclaim Open Hackathon at MIT. I'm still working off the fumes of that weekend, and to be fair a few subsequent meetings ?? The image above is a shot of what Kin was sketching out the architecture of Reclaim Your Domain, basically a domain-based hub that enables you to integrate and push all your various content to the appropriate sites, while maintaining the ""authoritative"" (probably the wrong term, but work with me here) copy in your own space.  The top of the diagram in the above image lists the various resources based on media, rather than services. Under that you have the technologies to push/pull content to the various sites. It will depend on either RSS (OG) or APIs to get that done, and the former will pull, the latter, utilizing JSON, will push the data where it needs to go. [It took me a year and a half to start wrapping my head around this.] Now, if we premise this on an individual's domain within a network (this was one of the coolest realizations for me during the hackathon) any site could be both a spoke or a hub. A faculty or student's domain could be a hub for syndicating content ? leveling some of the hierarchical biases baked into the course-driven learning management systems. Hubs created and managed by faculty may still be the norm with domains, but that is not an assumption built into the technical infrastructure.  And I wrote all that, to say this. Looking at the way Tim Owens created the custom Installatron package for Known in UMW Domains, the idea that every individual's domain at UMW has the ability of being both a spoke and a hub for content was realized.  Above you see fields of options you are offered when you create a Known site on UMW Domains. The radio buttons to choose between making this site a community hub, or connecting it to one is powerful choice. The learning system infrastructure is not necessarily unilateral. There was a lot of talk during the MOOC days ? remember them? ? about students creating their own communities in the forums, on Facebook, MeetUp, or some other abysmal platform. And why? Because it wasn't an option native to the systems, most of the VC-funded revolutionary MOOC platforms where LMSs that scaled big.  The platform that let's you keep control of your data, decide where to send your content, while refusing to distinguish your technical infrastructure from the course you are subscribed to is the outline that I am currently watching get colored in with Known. Kin had the idea that when you sign-up for your domain you would decide where you want to import and store your photos, tweets, videos, check-ins, etc. All the while you would get educated contextually, much like the video games do. With the Known hub Ben Werdmuller has made available to us at UMW, we are having students in a couple of experimental classes do just that.  They're authenticating into Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, SoundCloud, etc. and they're now posting through Known, keeping the ""authoritative"" copy. It's remarkable that a year and a half later one of the former developers of Elgg, along with Known co-founder Erin Jo Richey (designer from the IndieWebCamp school of thought) had already imagined something that fit this vision so well. At the same time, maybe it's not all that remarkable. Maybe a certain swath of web culture is starting to wake up to alternative means of publishing on the web, one in which we manage our online selves more assiduously. That's exactly what Domain of One's Own has been all about for years, and I think we're starting to see open source applications like Known begin to reflect those values.  At this point I am fairly certain Tim Owens and Ben Werdmuller could come up with a model that would make on-boarding new users for Domain of One's Own an exercise in getting everyone up and running with a Known site. But not simply to replace Known with WordPress, but to provide a seamless, yet contextualized, experience of what ownership on the web looks like. How push publishing works, and what the principles of a new, indieweb are. Make the on- boarding an experience akin to the first ten minutes of Half-Life 2, an introduction that attempts to scare you into how to play the game, or in this case the web ??  "Jim Groom,Digital Agency in the 21st Century,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-agency-in-the-21st-century/,9/9/2014,"I was just asked to submit an abstract for a presentation I may or may not give this Spring. I'm kind of enjoying being on hiatus from presenting, but I still get the itch ?? I jammed it out first thing this morning, and kind liked the marriage of agency, the Indieweb, and domains. I just need to work bot storytelling in there and it would be perfect ??  > This presentation will explore the importance of providing students, faculty, and staff with an innovative, web-based platform for owning, managing and migrating the digital work they create over the course of their academic career. What's more, this platform is not a proprietary, vendor-driven product, but an ecosystem of open source applications that are central to the critique and creation of their digital world. It's the backbone for a broader, curricular-wide push for cross-disciplinary digital fluency. In essence, the platform undergirding the pioneering work of Domain of One's Own at Mary Washington ? and several other campuses across the U.S at this point ? is, wait for itƒ.the open web. More than a learning system or publishing platform, UMW Domains recognizes and codifies the importance of each and every learner on campus managing their own piece of the web. What's more, through trailing edge technologies like commodity web hosting we can enable this for each individual at scale. The impact of the global information network on our campus community is not imagined or inferred, it is intentionally designed and cultivated. Welcome to the digital liberal arts, and the emergence of the Indieweb in higher ed. Can you grok the future?  "Jim Groom,Connected Courses: It's Time to Reclaim Your Domain,http://bavatuesdays.com/connected-courses-its-time-to-reclaim-your-domain/,9/11/2014,"Image credit: Amy Burvall  For more than a decade I've been circling around one pretty basic idea: the open web kicks learning management systems (LMS) asses when it comes to teaching and learning in higher ed. I've said it far less succinctly than that on numerous occasions, but my point has always pretty much the same. And Audrey Watter's nails it with her usual exactitude in a recent talk in Newcastle about the LMS:  > The learning management system has shaped a generation's view of education technology, and I'd contend, shaped it for the worst. It has shaped what many people think ed-tech looks like, how it works, whose needs it suits, what it can do, and why it would do so. The learning management system reflects the technological desires of administrators  ?  it's right there in the phrase. ""Management."" It does not reflect the needs of teachers and learners.  If that's the case, what are the needs of teachers and learners? Is it presumptuous for a few edtech folks to argue everyone should be using the open web? Probably, but that's not going to stop us. And I will turn again to Audrey's recent talk for an excellent reason why:  > If we think about new technologies like the Web as facilitating learning networks and as learners and learning communities as nodes on those networks, we can see a very different ""shape,"" if you will, to education technology than what the learning management system enables.  The web as learning network that isn't an insulated, hierarchical reproduction of a managed system is a reality higher ed seems to be hell bent on resisting. Why can't we imagine, for even a moment, the idea of user as developer that was prevalent in the early days of the web. Once upon a time we explored HTML and used FTP to upload files. Since then, creation on and through the web has gotten much more user-friendly. And, as Gardner Campbell notes in his essay on The Personal Cyberinfrastructure, we have arrived at a moment where a student can and should be the sysadmin of their education. The same holds true for faculty. What's more, with extensive experience over the last two years helping more than 1000 faculty, staff and students get their own domain and web hosting through UMW's Domain of One's Own project, I can confidently say it's easier than ever. And, to visually quote Amy Burvall, it moves us towards a technical infrastructure that privileges ""self over system.""  Image credit: Amy Burvall  And while ease and convenience can't be underestimated for faculty, it's the personal and professional opportunities available that are truly compelling: building your online identity, networking within your discipline, and designing curriculum centered around digital fluency. It seems to be a foregone conclusion that online learning, hybrid courses, and digitally rich classrooms are the future, yet the systems we provide to support this inevitable reality do little to nothing to reinforce any of the most basic rights of students, faculty, and staff.     Do you have control over your data? (Domains is about as FERPA compliant as you can get!)    Is the work you do in any given system easily exportable and ultimately affordable beyond your university experience?    Do you have the freedom to customize your online learning environment?  We have been working hard at UMW to start answering these questions. And having worked with more than 75 faculty over the last two years, and almost 1000 students, we've been able to answer yes to all three. This is the ""singleness of purpose"" driving the work we're doing at UMW. We see open sources publishing platforms like UMW Blogs, courses like ds106, and campus- wide initiatives like UMW Domains as compelling examples of resistance to higher ed's fifteen year addiction to the LMS.  And the shift starts pretty simply. The path to empowerment is through acknowledging and reclaiming ownership of your world online. Over the course of the next 12 weeks I'm committed to help any and all faculty playing along with Connected Courses get up and running with their own domain and web hosting. This was the impetus behind the original vision of the course: create resources for faculty who wanted to build a course-hub on their own domain like the one Howard Rheingold and I worked through in this three part video series. Those videos were the beginning of a larger idea of creating resources that would support faculty interested in setting up their own domain and web hosting.  To that end, we created the Connected Courses documentation that provides an overview of web hosting, domains, as well as ton of specifics about CPanel, WordPress, and more. If you ever wanted to dig into managing your digital life online but never felt comfortable based on time investment and support, this is your lucky semester! Use any web hosting service you like, but the documentation above is specific to the CPanel GUI interface for managing your slice of a server. Also, if you want targeted support for your web space, I recommend starting out with Reclaim Hosting. Full disclosure: this is hosting service Tim Owens and I run, and I recommend it because it means we can help you in very targeted ways.  Image credit: Amy Burvall  So, as you follow along for the next twelve weeks consider this an opportunity to fully explore the tools available to create and manage your own space online.  "Jim Groom,Becoming Well Known,http://bavatuesdays.com/becoming-well-known/,9/19/2014,"Known: the Writing is on the Wall  It was cool to see Ben Werdmuller's and Erin Jo Richeyïs Indieweb application Known featured in this recent Wired article. They've been red hot lately, with an appearance last week on an episode of ""This Week in Google"" dedicated to the IndieWeb. The attention is justified, and can be attributed to the fact that Known represents an elegant, easy-to-use application that embodies the ethos of the Indieweb, namely POSSE: publish on your own site and syndicate elsewhere.  We've been lucky enough to hook up with Ben and Erin, and even spent time together at the Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in LA, to get up and running with Known. Since August we've been working together to use Known as the syndication hub for the Wire106 course I'm teaching at UMW. It puts students in control of authoring in their own space, allowing them to push their work to a variety of social media networks like Twitter, SoundCloud, Facebook, and Flickr. Additionally, they can also push to a course hub, dramatically changing how simple it is to aggregate student work for a given course.  And that's not the only Known experiment happening at UMW this semester. English professor Zach Whalen picked up on its value immediately, and is using it in his Digital Studies 101 course as well. Jeff McClurkenïs Infoage students are considering incorporating it into a database project later this semester. I also know Sue Fernsebner is fired up to explore it in the Spring.  And it doesn't stop there, David Morgen ? the man behind Emory University's Domain of One's Own project ? was exploring what Known might mean for simplifying syndication with Tim Owens and I just this morning. Fact is, this is a very compelling piece of software for demonstrating the tenets of the indieweb in a practical and relevant way. What has been central to the publishing philosophy we've been pushing at UMW for many years is embodied in the logic behind Known: 1) control your own work, and 2) syndicate it far and wide. It would be nothing short of revolutionary for the work we're doing with Domain of One's Own if it became dead simple for an entire campus to do both these things with Known.  "Jim Groom,Catching Up with Reclaim Hosting,http://bavatuesdays.com/catching-up-with-reclaim-hosting/,9/21/2014,"In episode 106 of Digital Campus (a.k.a dc106-coincidence? I think not) the director of the Roy Rosensweig Center for History and New Media, Stephen Robertson, gives a shout out to Reclaim Hosting suggesting how ""absurdly easy"" it is for students and faculty to setup and manage their own applications on their own domains. I couldn't agree more.  I included a minute and 15 seconds of the discussion before Robertson mentions Reclaim because I'm interested in what Tom Scheinfeldt suggests is the paradox of teaching digital media: you can't teach it online. I think one of the greatest learning experiences for me over the last five years of teaching ds106 ? it's really been that long! ? is that you actually can teach digital media online. But it requires the right platform and a lot of time and freedom to experiment. Giving students their own web hosting space and a domain is one way at it, and ,as Robertson notes, it provides the platform for both an individualized and distributed online experience that institutional learning systems aren't even beginning to imagine.  But I want to believe that's changing a bit, and the work Tim Owens and I are doing with Reclaim Hosting has been awesome for this very reason. We think we're starting to provide different possibilities that people can consider. And given the regular notes I get from folks near and far about it's value to them, it just reinforces that a lot of people want alternatives. Why aren't more schools providing web hosting for their students and faculty? Hell, if a domain is too costly for your students and faculty, you can still provide web hosting through a subdomain model.  CSU Channel islands Subdomain of One's Own ??  In fact, Tim built a setup for CSU Channel Islands CSU Channel Islands that provides users with a subdomain setup by default, but allows them to choose at the time of signup, or any time after that, if they want to addon a domain they purchase themselves. And this isn't rocket science, you don't need Reclaim Hosting to do this, you just need the will to recognize that by-and- large we are not providing viable digital spaces for our communities to explore the web.  Emory Domains  Emory University (http://emorydomains.org/) has been exploring the Domain of One's own approach for over a year now, and this academic year they got their own server and are doing some amazing things. To give a well deserved shout- out, the work David Morgen is doing down at Emory University in just this regard is amazing. Just take a look at the number of faculty exploring this, and the feed of posts being created on the various domains across the university. So good.  The University of Oklahoma's Domain project ""OU Create""  Display at Unviersity of Oklahoma promoting open source apps on OU Create  But crazier yet, the University of Oklahoma has gone full bore providing up to 1000 students and faculty with their own domain and web hosting through their pilot OU Create. Tim and I spent time with Adam Croom and Mark Morvant in Norman, OK in late July (I still have to blog that), and they really have an amazingly strong handle on what's possible. Adam has blogged about his thinking around the project a couple of times recently. Like Tim and I, he really believes in the transformative potential of such a pilot. He's even going full bore with tag-based course syndication! It also doesn't hurt that he OU community is digging deep to help build excitement and gain traction. In particular, their provost, Kyle Harper, not only groked what Adam and Mark are trying to do, but was as excited and supportive as any administrator I'd ever seen. Tim and I came away from Oklahoma thinking this just might be scalable beyond our wildest dreams. It's the biggest pilot Reclaim has done yet, and we couldn't have asked for better partners. Hell, they even have their campus tech stores promoting what's possible with open source applications through this pilot. I'm a Sooner #4life!  OU Create Window Display  So, all this to say, I've been remiss posting about all the awesome stuff happening in the Reclaim Hosting world. Tim is finishing off the Davidson College server that will launch Davidson Domains very soon. CSU Channel Islands are exploring a slick subdomains project, and the great Pete Rorbaugh has more than 200 faculty and students with their own domains and web hosting through Reclaim at Southern Polytechnic State University.  The excitement and momentum around Reclaim over the past three or four months has Tim and I a bit dazed, to be honest. And given how intense our day job has been lately, we haven't had much time to think about it, no less plan for the future. But whether through Reclaim Hosting or some other avenue, moving beyond what's readily available to provide an extensible platform like a LAMP web hosting environment for both faculty and students has arrived. In fact, it's been here for the last 12 years, we just couldn't get out heads out of the LMS long enough to see it. Where and how we teach, learn, research, publish, and share in the future is not inevitable. It's time to reclaim!  "Jim Groom,A Subdomain of One's Own (with potential!),http://bavatuesdays.com/a-subdomain-of-ones-own-with-potential/,9/22/2014,"The following screencast by Michael McGarry <del>Chris Mattia</del> provides an introduction to CI Keys platform, illustrating how to get up and running with your web hosting account in seconds. It's pretty awesome, watch the first minute or two, your mind may very well be blown.  As I mentioned in my post yesterday about the various developments on the Reclaim Hosting front, CSU Channel Islands is providing their community with a subdomain of their own, something like jimgroom.cikeys.com, that gives them a fullblown cPanel-equipped web hosting environment. Not unlike the next generation of tilde spaces (/~jimgroom) I spent much of last year presenting about.  Now I understand this is not necessarily a Domain of One's Own as UMW imagined it (where's the domain?), but it does represent a very interesting hybrid of possbilities. The Channel Islands community has access to all the same open sources applications provides through cPanel. What's more, at signup students and faculty alike have the option to purchase or simply point their own domain to their web hosting account if they want. I like the fact it recognizes that institutions may not be able to purchase domains for their community for whatever reason, but doesn't preclude it as an option either. In fact, the purchasing of the domains is a significant cost when setting up a domains pilot, and may be a conversation killer for some who are interested in doing this. So an option like this might enable even more folks to experiment with such an environment for their campus. Access rules.  Finally, the way Tim Owens set this bad boy up for Channel Islands is so slick. It's integrated with their authentication system, and it really does challenge the assumption that managing your own LAMP environment is too confusing or complicated. Damn that Timmmyboy is good. We've come a long way, baby! So what's your excuse not to get with the future now, hippies?  "Jamison Miller,Opening up the Web for Students and Faculty,http://at.blogs.wm.edu/opening-up-the-web-for-students-and-faculty/,10/21/2014,"Image courtesy of Jim Groom's website.  Last fall, our neighbors just two and a half hours to the north at the University of Mary Washington launched an eye-opening program for their students, faculty, and staff. It is a service to allow users to register an Internet domain and house it on internal servers, called A Domain of One's Own. The name is an allusion, it seems, to Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, a treatise on the marginalization of women writers in a patriarchal literary tradition. In this case, the focus is on empowering digital citizens to carve out their own spaces on the Web to develop their digital identity, thoughts, and networks outside of the corporatized Internet tradition.  ### College Students and Digital Literacy  The project falls within larger conversations about digital literacies for college students that I alluded to in my last post. Offering access to server space and a domain opens up the opportunity for the college community to explore using the Web outside of privately designed and controlled programs and applications. Users can develop websites that are either publicly available to the entire Web, or privately to a select group.  The UMW team has done a tremendous amount of work to make A Domain of One's Own as user-friendly as possible, grounding user navigation within their home WordPress site. Intriguingly, they make the migration of all of the content straightforward and simple: Students and faculty can readily take all of their work with them when they move on from school. The idea behind their work and the detailed documentation of it is to support others' development of similar projects on their campuses. Maybe we can start to imagine something like this at William & Mary.  ### The Possibilities of This Kind of Program Are Limitless  The program actively supports curricular explorations by organizing regular faculty meetings to discuss implications and possibilities of incorporating the Web space into coursework and assignments. For instance, websites on the server can be aggregated by a department, course, or faculty member so that associated content can be found and students can share work. But if we understand these domains as entirely blank slates, on to which anything can be drawn, the possibilities are limitless. For more details about recent updates to the platform, check out one of the projects spear-headers, Jim Groom's, blog.  Image courtesy of the OpenVA website.  The project also resonates with larger conversation about open education that are gaining traction in Virginia. On October 18th the second annual OpenVA meeting was held at Tidewater Community College's Virginia Beach campus. The sessions focused on three topics: Open infrastructure, open content and resources, and open pedagogy and curriculum. I attended along with Swem's Arts Librarian, Kathleen Delaurenti. We took lots of notes and pictures, and will be back on the AT Blog shortly with some ideas.  ### Related posts:    1. Developing Alternative Research Assignments with Students and Faculty   2.

This was a must-see for me because so much of the work I've been part of over the last five years (ds106, UMW Domains, and Reclaim Hosting) is inspired by a more robust and engaging approach to web literacy at UMW and beyond. The idea that there are certain key concepts like tags, syndication, aggregation, etc. that both faculty and students meed to wrap their head around to get a sense of the power and possibility of the greatest of all communication revolutions.  This vision inspired the thinking behind ds106 which helped demonstrate Domain of One's Own was scalable for the entire institution. Whereas, for clarification purposes, Reclaim Hosting is the vehicle by which we'll scale it for the rest of higher ed ?? So, needless to say, I have a lot invested in the idea that thinking like the web needs to be a fundamental element of higher ed moving forward, and thanks to Tim Owens I can and will back it up with servers and domains for all my friends!  But that's not exactly, precisely what I was planning on writing about. What I wanted to note was at 34:50 of the video archive of this webinar discussion Udell talks about the fact that writing is not the primary mode of expression on the web. Rather, it's a platform of the diverse literacies including video, audio, visual, design thinking and more. TO make his point, he used the example of a manufacturer of furniture repair parts sending him a video to demonstrate how much pressure to apply when hammering a particular piece, something that might be far harder to communicate via text. This idea being that sharing videos provides a fairly new (in terms of ease, access, and immediacy) and rather powerful medium for showing and demonstrating a physical action.  At the same time, video, like writing, is a form that has conventions, grammar, syntax, etc. And to what degree are are we helping students interpolate these other modes of literacy. We've just begun the video section of ds106, and one of the clips we are asking the students to reflect on the visual rhetoric employed in the opening sequence of Fritz Lang's M (1931).  I know art, film and communication departments have been teaching this for decades, but when listening to Udell and Rheingold talk it became apparent this needs to be a more fundamental way of seeing and thinking at universities, much like writing essays became the primary currency for near on a century. I think it's painfully clear we should be cultivating multi-modal literacies across disciplines and departments. And they should be focused on the ways in which these various media are playing out on the most remarkable and fairly complex expression engine to date: the web. But few, if any universities, are taking this on as a core part of their mission, which seems insane 25 years after the web claimed half the world's population as its own.  The many of us who came together to build ds106 had no idea what we were doing, but part of me wants to believe we were trying to imagine what such a curriculum might look like and how we would get at it in a fun and engaging way. I'm not sure we failed entirely ??  "Jim Groom,Reclaim the Web with Reclaim Hosting,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-the-web-with-reclaim-hosting/,10/31/2014,"Image credit: ""No Dash for Gas"" http://www.nodashforgas.org.uk/  Yesterday Tim Owens finished up the ""10 Reasons to Reclaim"" series on the Reclaim Hosting blog. Granted I'm biased, but I think what he's laying down in that series ? especially the #1 reason to Reclaim ? is arguably the most innovative infrastructural work happening in edtech. Why? Well, he's taken what we've learned helping schools get up and running with their Domain of One's Own projects and made it dead simple and dirt cheap for any school ? no matter how big or small, rich or poor ? to get up and running.  For $199 a month a department, school, or university can start exploring what it would mean to give faculty, staff, and students a domain of their own with web hosting. While this price doesn't include a unique domain like mysite.com (though that could be easily arranged), it does provide a subdomain on any given top level domain, such as jimgroom.reclaim.host, that has access to a cPanel interface with the ability to install applications, map a domain, create an email, etc. You can get a trial account to see exactly what I'm talking about here: http://reclaim.host/  How could schools not afford to experiment with this? I think the innovation here is four-fold:     It's an excellent platform for controlling one's own data and identity    It meets a growing need for digital projects, courses, and portfolios    It's eminently affordable    It can be seamlessly integrated into a school's authentication system making it dead simple to rollout  Don't believe me? Try get up and running with your own subdomain here, and tell me you can't see faculty, staff, and students doing this?  What excites me most about this whole thing is that Tim has formalized and scaled a vision we've had for a while at UMW. Finding ways to share the innovation we've been working on with as many people as possible. We did it with UMW Blogs back in 2008, but that was a one-off approach that we couldn't support and sustain beyond one school. Reclaim Hosting is for real, with the recent ten reasons series we're doubling down on just how serious we are about making the work we do accessible to just about anyone.  This marks a highpoint for the edtech work I've been part of over the last decade. Rather than just bemoaning existing possibilities or pointing out the limits of the existing infrastructure (something I'm certainly guilty of), Reclaim marks an intervention into technical reality behind it. We're offering something we believe in, we can scale, and we want to support. We're making it easier and cheaper for colleges and universities to enable their communities to invest in the open web again. It's time to reclaim the power of the web with (or without) Reclaim Hosting. We've just made it easier. Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  "Audrey Watters,Maggie's Digital Content Farm,http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/maggies-digital-content-farm/,11/4/2014,"This piece was contributed as part of Hybrid Pedagogyïs Digital Writing Month.      Over the course of the last 6 months or so, I've felt a real shift in what it means (for me) to write  ?  to work, to be  ?  online. And let's be clear: this affects me offline too.  I'm hardly the first or the only person to notice that the great promises of the Web  ?  freedom! knowledge! access! egalitarianism! creativity! revolution!  ?  are more than a little empty. I'm hardly the first or the only person to notice that the online communities in which we participate increasingly feel less friendly, less welcoming, more superficial, more controlling, more restrictive.  Online, we seem to be more and more short-tempered and sharp-tongued. It feels less and less sustainable. It's taking a toll on me, personally  ?  the status updates, the sneers, the threats, the responsibilities, the accolades, the comments, the deadlines. All of it.  I've long been ""a critic"" of ed-tech, to be sure. That's what my work, my writing is known for.  But what I'm feeling now is new. It's different. As such, I recognize  ?  for me, my work, my writing  ?  with a growing sense of urgency that I need to re- evaluate my own use of digital technologies ? as a writer. as a worker, as a human.  I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  Well, I wake in the morning  Fold my hands and pray for rain  I got a head full of ideas  That are drivin' me insane  It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor  I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  It's hard to mark the moment in the early 1960s when Bob Dylan ""changed,"" when  ?  as we'd tell the story now, at least  ?  enough was enough.  Bob Dylan recorded ""Maggie's Farm"" in 1965. There are lots of interpretations of the song's lyrics, and much to be said about the song's origins and its subsequent performances.  The song first appeared on Bringing It Back Home  ?  an album that's often used to mark one of the many shifts in Dylan's career; but it was the performance of the song at the Newport Folk Festival that same year  ?  loud and electric  ?  that elicited those infamous boos from the audience and prompted that final split between Dylan and the folk music movement.  Some point out that, like a lot of Dylan's music, the song is simply an adaptation of an earlier folk song  ?  in this case the Bentley Brother's 1929 recording of ""Down on Penny's Farm,"" which also criticizes rural landlords who systematically exploit day-laborers.  Some say ""Maggie's Farm"" is a pun on the surname of Silas McGee, on whose farm in Greensboro, Mississippi Dylan performed ""Only a Pawn in Their Game"" during a voter registration rally, as featured in the D. A. Pennebaker documentary Don't Look Back.  Some argue that ""Maggie's Farm"" is a protest song against protest music, condemning those in ""the scene"" who are quick to profit off of the creativity and the fury of others, all the while pretending that they do so as part of some larger progressive political project.  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  Well, he hands you a nickel  He hands you a dime  He asks you with a grin  If you're havin' a good time  Then he fines you every time you slam the door  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  New Media, we were told, would displace Old Media. The Internet would change things. Radically.  Old institutions  ?  those which controlled who could be published, those who would be deemed experts, and as such who could be heard  ?  would crumble. New voices would be recognized; new voices would be heard.  A radical democracy of ""the folk,"" if you will.  The readable, writable Web would encourage a flourishing of cultural production, distributed and supported through more equitable frameworks. Creatives, no matter who or where, would be able make a living being creative.  As a freelance writer on the Web, I write. I speak. My writing is read and shared widely. Despite that, as a freelance writer on the Web, I still struggle to be heard. I struggle to make ends meet. I have to hustle for gigs, and I have to hassle folks for payment. I always have to hassle folks for payment.  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  Well, he puts his cigar  Out in your face just for kicks  His bedroom window  It is made out of bricks  The National Guard stands around his door  Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  I've long been an advocate for writers  ?  well, all of us really  ?  to own our own domains. A domain of one's own, much like a room of one's own as Virginia Woolf insisted, is an important and necessary space to think and to work.  In this so-called Information Age, having a domain of one's own isn't simply a means to produce writing; it's a means to distribute it as well. To publish. To manage and control one's ""intellectual property."" To manage and control the metadata surrounding its dissemination and consumption.  The Web promised openness. Open access. Open knowledge. Collaboration. Distribution.  Instead what we have today is a mass of information silos and content farms.  What we have today, if we're honest with ourselves, are old hierarchies hard coded onto new ones.  New media, new websites often demand we sign over our intellectual property. If they don't ask outright for copyright, they demand a license to such  ?  ""you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with [whatever].""  [Whatever] sells ads against that content. [Whatever] grants access to data to their partners.  [Whatever] [Whatever] [Whatever]  ?  that seems to be the response from most folks in ed-tech. A shrug. An acquisition, one that is seemingly happy to work on someone else's farm  ?  the LMS, the academic journal. But to work there oneself is one thing; to demand one's students work in these silos, on these farms as wellƒ that's horrifying.  That's wrong.  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  Well, she talks to all the servants  About man and God and law  Everybody says  She's the brains behind pa  She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  I'm frustrated with so much of ed-tech. Surveillance. Control. Frustrated and exhausted by the demands that we participate in technologies that are exploitative and extractive. I'm increasingly concerned that we're asking people to participate in technologies, practices, online communities, ""farms,""  ?  that are profoundly, profoundly unsafe.  How does one protest that?  Refuse to participate online?  Move one's participation elsewhere? New songs? New communities?  Dylan's protest in 1965 was to plug in. Mine, I don't knowƒ it might be to unplug.  But if nothing else, I tell you this: I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm. And I think you need to think about your own work. Where you work. For whom.  And then you must consider where you demand your students work. For whom they work. Who profits. Where that content, where that data, where those dimes flow.  On whose farm are you working? On whose farm are you demanding your students work? To what end? For whose profits?  Are they safe there? Are you safe there? Are you sure?  I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  Well, I try my best To be just like I am  But everybody wants you  To be just like them  They say sing while you slave and I just get bored  I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  "Meredith,Domain of One's Own Debrief,http://www.mgregory.org/part-play/domain-of-ones-own-debrief/,12/10/2014,"Domain of One's Own Debrief  In September I never would have thought I would have my own website. Plenty of schools and organizations provided me space on their website, for example, my high school, Facebook, Twitter, and Eagle Net from the University of Mary Washington. These sites were hosting me. Now, I can host others and share anything and everything about me and my life on my own space ? a domain of my own.  So, who am I? What about me and my life do others want to know. Within Participatory Play, my fellow classmates wanted to know my take on several articles relevant to the class, they wanted to know every new development in my game design process, as well as my opinion on several different online games. In the same way, I wanted to learn these things about each of them. The Domain of One's Own campaign was the perfect platform for this exchange of information. With the ability to comment on posts, the platform becomes interactive and a marketplace of ideas on any and all topics.  While my website can share lots of information about my class, this is a space about me not about the class. With customizable themes, endless numbers of widgets, plenty of storage, each website becomes personal and truly reflective of who each of us are. With an ""About"" page preloaded onto the sites the space is just waiting for us to fill it all about who we are as people interacting with the world, not just as class members. Upon browsing through each of the Participatory Play members' domains each one's personality shines through loud and clear. My ""About"" page, full of pictures, states the simple words ""collect MOMENTS not THINGS."" This quote explains how I live my life. I then included a collection of photos that remind me of all my favorite moments from my life. Through these photos a viewer understands exactly what makes me tick.  When asked to describe myself, as in the instance of filling an ""About"" page, the last characteristic I would ever include is ""creative."" In my experience ""creative"" translates into ""can go arts and crafts very well"" or ""is very imaginative."" I am neither. However, creativity gained a new outlet through the Domain of One's Own campaign. By changing themes and layouts and adding pictures and other media, a student can truly be creative. These domains, however, don't solely allow a student to be creative with the aesthetics of the website but also with the content. Facilitating spontaneous and casual writing, these domains encourage students to write for fun and in creative ways.  The world relies more on technology with every passing day. In this world computer skills are imperative to success in the working world. What better way to demonstrate these skills than show off a domain created entirely by you and for you? With s ""Resume"" page preloaded onto the domains easy editing creates a perfect resume right away. Easily editable, this resume will be up to date at all times for employers to check back on in the future. Not only do you have a portable, easily accessible resume, but you also have a digital portfolio of original work to show off. This professional use of the space leaves a lasting impression on potential employers. In addition to having the website, the ability to operate Word Press is a highly marketable skill today. When listing this skill on a resume, the perfect example of your skills is a matter of clicks away.  The Domain of One's Own campaign provides endless opportunities for students. These opportunities include a personal space to be themselves, an interactive discussion platform, and a career building tool. This multidimensional asset is of immense benefit to students at the University of Mary Washington.  "Madison Doehler,Debrief #1: Domain of One's Own,http://www.mdsnd.net/debrief/debrief-1-domain-of-ones-own/,12/10/2014,"Madison Doehler  Debriefs  Participatory Play: Games beyond Walls  2014  Debrief #1: Domain of One's Own  Let me just say that I am very pleased with having had the opportunity to experience website science and anatomy. In the beginning of the course, I was blatantly terrified with the entire concept. Files, links, categories, and a dashboard were very intimidating to me, for I had not had any experience with technology like this. My major concern was that I would mess up, underperform, and because of this, not do well in the class. Allow for me to elaborate on how I have learned to be a bit more comfortable with this and how this will help me with learning experiences like the ones in Participatory Play in the future.  The idea of a game design log seems simple, but I did in fact learn something, and wouldn't have without the utilization of Domain of One's Own. In the beginning, I had a ""mess page"" for my game content. It worked, and I was pleased, but Dr. Kayler introduced the concept of the log thru Domain of One's Own. My initial thought was oh dear. I knew I would fall victim of my own misfeasance. Now, as I look back, I can identify the thoughts I had, the ideas that I thought would work that I have long forgotten about, interesting facts I found, the sequence in which everything happened, and most importantly, I have tangible evidence. With Domain of One's Own, I learned to cooperate with the material ? -in organized chaos! The Game Design Log would not have been as effective had we done more traditional methods: journals, essays, etc. Thru Domain of One's Own, I can prove my progress and skills.  For a long time, up until this semester actually, I was most definitely the ""go-getter"" type, as we learned in ""The Game of School."" This wasn't a bad thing, for I knew my deadlines, my limits, and what had to be done. However, I was in for a big surprise when I found out that everything in the class was going to be technology-based, hands-on, and not exactly black and white. This is one things that made me a bit nervous when we started Domain of One's Own. As I mentioned before, I have learned to be productive and comfortable with this type of technology and learning. Working bit by bit, as Dr. Kayler reminded me, could be done with the Game Design Log, the Blog Posts Assignments, the Phases, and other ambiguous processes. So in conclusion, Domain of One's Own has allowed for me to step out of my comfort zone, to explore the gray area, and to accept that not everything is a black and white checklist, but an uncertain mess I'll just have to work through!  I am grateful for this experience, and most importantly, I am thrilled that I can actually see my progress and evolution of ideas ? physically, and in a way I was never ever comfortable with. Looking back at my earliest posts, I can tell that I was once the high school go-getter who was only interested in finishing tasks and getting posts over with, and I can also see the work I have done for my game. Lastly, I have a better chance of catching up with my fellow Millenials in the technology sector! This is all evidence that I have succeeded in this type of learning environment, and am ready for such challenges in the future!  "Jim Groom,The Wire Come to Life,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-wire-come-to-life/,12/10/2014,"For the final project in Wire 106 students were asked to chose a character from the HBO series The Wire and build an online presence for them across several social media sites. It's been interesting experience these narratives because they hit me at the strangest times when I'm not looking for a story. For example, a couple of weeks ago Omar Little request to follow me on LinkedIn. I never setup a LinkedIn account, but after getting the email from Omar I felt compelled ? but only a bit by fear ? to comply with his wish ?? After setting up a LinkedIn account and following Omar, it turns out he didn't have much in his account as of yet given it was brand new, so I soon moved on.  However, a number of people have been discovering I am on LinkedIn now and started following me. I've been avoiding following people back because I'm fairly certain this experiment on LinkedIn will be short-lived, but I have been fascinated by the job culture of this network. We recently had Phil Windley and Kelly Flannagan from BYU here at UMW to talk about the work we're doing with Domain of One's Own. We had a great day, and the work they're spearheading at BYU in terms of imagining a university-wide API is truly visionary, but I'll save my thoughts on that for my next post.  Anyway, after the visit Phil followed me on LinkedIn, and I clicked on the link to check out his profile. Once I did I noticed a small notification on the right-hand side of the page that Omar Little has a new job.  I was intrigued and followed the link.  Turns out Omar got a job as a cafeteria worker at BWI Airport. Now that might seem arbitrary to those of you who've never seen the series, as well as for some who have. But this is an important detail from the show. Omar tells his grandma he works in a cafeteria at the airport because he knows she'll never go there in order to hide his true life as a stick-up artist.  The beauty of this kind of distributed, transmedia project is all in the details. And this one blew my mind because I wasn't expecting it, it hit me while I was going about my ""normal"" life on the internet. That said, it led me to imagine the true power of such a narrative for the class. Not only because it suggests a close reading of the show, but also because it in many ways subverts the whole enterprise of LinkedIn. This act highlights the subterfuge at the hear of a long gone patina of respectability and dignity in the American workplace. No character in The Wire knows better that the game is played by gangsters and professionals alike ? and just as ruthlessly. How's that for the power of a single status update?! Kudos to Melinda Albrycht, the mastermind behind the curtain of Omar, she did a brilliant job with the entire class, and her transmedia version of Omar was no exception.  You might have also noticed that Frank Sobotka was one of the people LinkedIn thought I might know, and it turns out I did know Frank. We go way back to days before the containerization of the dock. But that's a tale for another post. As you might imagine, the rest of the evening was lost to a Wire 106 transmedia rabbit hole that highlighted how much the beauty of this form of storytelling lies in its truly liminal position between the worlds of fiction and non, imagined and real, virtual and concrete. And this is just one of many, many examples. Stay tuned for more.  "Jim Groom,Indie Web Domains,http://bavatuesdays.com/indie-web-domains/,12/11/2014,"Tomorrow Tim Owens and I will be talking with a group of faculty at Davidson College about their Davidson Domains initiative. Over dinner we were talking about how we could provide a broader context for the work we are doing beyond a specific Domain of One's Own initiative. Don't get me wrong, I love a good domain project. Schools like Emory, Oklahoma, and Channel Islands are showing the way. But I think it's dangerous to suggest this is happening in a vacuum. And that's probably why I'm digging the Indie Web movement, it provides a broader view of the cultural moment we find ourselves in, and why a Domain of One's Own project might be relevant for all kinds of reasons ? but also how it's not any one thing either. I keep thinking a domains project needs to move well beyond UMW for it to be a success, but each one also needs to be its own.  What if we thought about universities doing domains projects, kinda like indie labels promoting unknown bands and a seeding a local scene. Domains could provide an infrastructure of support and promotion for the faculty, students, clubs, groups, projects, etc. that is all done in their own space. Reinforcing a DIY ethic inherited from punk. What if each school was known by the variety of it's different approaches, ideas, and visions for what the independent web means.  Which ultimately led me to thinking about Superchunk, a mainstay indie rock band that just so happens to be a home team favorite given I'm currently writing this from North Carolina. One of my favorite albums of the 1990s, Foolish, was Superchunk's first full LP release on their own label Merge Records.  Merge is a label that over the past 25 years became a cultural resource that supported a wide range of bands not only locally, but from around the globe. Most recently Canada's immensely popular Arcade Fire had a number 1 selling album on Merge. The cross-over in terms of what a platform like domains could do to promote a culture of critical thought, aesthetics, and empowerment is really enticing. An indie label suggests a certain amount of freedom from commercialization. It also highlights artist's keeping control over their work, along with a sense of purpose beyond the major labels' predominant logic of success driven by sales.  With the indie web ? which probably finds its best representative in IndieWebCamp ? much of what is highlighted is a people-focused alternative to the ubiquitous corporate web.  And you'll notice how much the focus is on retaining your content, getting better connected, and taking control. A web that promotes a network of independent sites that each devise a vision and aesthetic that riffs upon a broader community, yet retains it's sense of uniqueness seems a lot like a thriving indie scene, right? There would be no better place for something like that than a series of loosely connected, yet independent and self-determined university communities who want to cultivate a web of creative agency. Is it a coincidence Superchunk and Merge Records came out of the Raleigh-Durham area?  All this to say, the indie web provides a necessary frame for the why of domain of one's own. The crucial piece is how you imagine what you are brining to campus. Is it just another system? Just another space to publish? Or is it a concerted movement to try and highlight, promote, and share the variegated work colleges and universities do as a community. Forging a sense of community is the hardest part of anything like this, but the key is we aren't working in isolation. People are thinking about the importance of owning their work, publishing on their own site and syndicating elsewhere, maintaining the canonical URLs of their thoughts, images, videos, bookmarks, etc. and recognizing, to quote Ben Werdmuller, that the web is made up of people not services, and its time we start recognizing and celebrating that fact. And what better way than with a domain?  "Jim Groom,A University API,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-university-api/,12/11/2014,"As I mentioned in my last post, the Chief Information Architect (Phil Windley) and CIO (Kelly Flannagan) of Brigham Young University visited UMW last week to learn more about the Domain of One's Own project we've been running for the last couple of years. They have a really compelling vision for Domain of One's Own that in many ways hearkens back to Jon Udellïs broader notion of digital identity across all domains of society. They see domain's across a spectrum that begins long before students get to BYU and long after they graduate. And this space isn't just about their education, it's a broader vision of a kind of personal interface for one's online world that enables them to manage, share, and archive the various lifebits they accrue over time.  Thanks to Kin Lane's white paper The University of API I had a pretty good idea of what Phil and Kelly have been up to at BYU over the last decade or so:  > It takes a forward thinking IT group, that is aware of what has been happening across the tech landscape over the last 14 years, with APIs. This type of transition in thinking can be seen playing out at Brigham Young University with their over 250+ APIsƒ.BYU is still just beginning to get a handle on what a centralized developer area will look like, let alone an organized and consistent approach to designing, deploying and managing APIs.  They have been working to create what they called a ""University API""  ? a consistent, structured API across all the various systems to enable their community to access, share, and analyze a wide variety of data from across the university. It's a pretty bold vision, and I had the pleasure of sitting in while they explained it to our IT group. I was blown away by how these two are rethinking the way in which we share data across the university, and the discussion helped me further grok the value and import of APIs more generally. (I'm getting there, Kin!)  What struck me as the day went on is that for BYU, Domain of One's Own represents a model that provides faculty and students an access point for data literacy, agency, and broader control over what's being provided by their University API. Not to mention the tools to innovate with that data. The domain is a personal API; a space where individuals becomes increasingly empowered to understand, manage, hack, and share the data that defines them.  "Andrew Allemann,Interesting: A Domain of One's Own at University of Mary Washington,http://domainnamewire.com/2014/12/23/interesting-a-domain-of-ones-own-at-university-of-mary-washington/,12/23/2014,"Program helps students register their first domain name and create a web presence.  When I started college in the mid-1990s, the web was really just getting off the ground. Websites contained lots of silly things, and most of us non- techies designed them using software like Frontpage or HotDog. Oh, and I had to dial-in to internet service.  Email and webhosting were nascent. The university offered us an email address at the mail.utexas.edu domain name, and we could also using hosting space on the university's servers. A typical address was something like web.utexas.edu/Önetwork/collegename/yourname/files/index.html. When you left the university, your email address and hosting were deleted.  A lot has happened since then. Yet colleges still offer many short-term internet services to students. Which is why a program at University of Mary Washington in Virgina stands out.  The program, which I first heard about in this 2014 trends post, is called A Domain of One's Own. (Yes, the program site is on a .domains domain name.)  A Domain of One's Own helps students, faculty and staff register a domain name of their own and then associate it with hosting space managed by the school. They can also use it for third party services like Tumblr. Importantly, students can take the the domain and content with them when they leave.  The program has helped students register and use over 1,000 domain names so far.  According to Audrey Watters at HackEducation, similar programs are being started at other universities.  This is an interesting concept, and I think it presents a great opportunity for new top level domain name companies. For many students, the site they create in college is their first.

I've been a vocal supporter of a similar ""Maker Movement"" that has risen up in recent years in education as a result of the explosion of 3D printing, robotics, and a renewed focus on project-based learning. The parallels between the two ideas are quite obvious, and yet it seems like regular reminder of The Web We Lost is necessary to bring us back to a reality where we can reclaim our sense of identity to the DIY community.  #### A (<strike>Very</strike> Somewhat Brief) Personal History of the Web  I cut my teeth on Compuserve and Angelfire. As a child of the 90s only getting access to the World Wide Web in the second half of the 90s, I somehow stumbled upon the fact that Compuserve provided server space with every dialup account. The ability to get something like 10Mb of storage on a web site was a feature of several internet companies and contributed to a larger culture of self- publishing during that timeframe. We equate it with Geocities but it's roots spread much further than that with Aol, Tripod, Angelfire, and so many more hosts providing free, ad-supported spaces online. Part of this for me (and others I'd imagine) was a curiousity for what the web could be. This shiny new thing that allowed me to communicate with an audience beyond my living room became a sandbox for experimentation. The web provided a platform for creativity and content production that seemed so foreign to me as a high- schooler who had never traveled beyond the city limits.  When I left for Germany as a foreign exchange student in 2000, it seemed like the web was the perfect platform for communicating my whereabouts and experiences to my family back home. The ""sandbox experimentation"" drove me to reverse-engineer the HTML of sites whose designs I enjoyed as frameworks for my own. In addition I can vividly remember primitive attempts at live- streaming video from Germany to my parents living room using an $80 webcam and a script on my computer that would update a flash page every second with a JPEG image from the camera. I felt connected like never before and that sense of experimentation extended upon my return to the US.  #### Trading Spaces  I returned to the US and finished out my final year of high school and then began my studies at Longwood University. Older friends waxed poetic of the speed of college networks and the ability to do ""hardcore gaming"" in your dorm. I was much more interested in this thing called MySpace which showed up and seemed to be the defacto way of building spaces on the web. Like many of my friends I wanted to be connected and quickly got MySpace setup, but this was different. Gone were the editing tools of the 90s, now we had checkboxes and text areas with pre-defined questions and content to fill out. Easy enough, but with a loss of personalization.  And yet, somehow we figured out how to hack the system. As a society we pushed on the infrastructure to expose the ability to edit HTML and CSS within a MySpace page and a cottage industry of templates, builders, and designers popped up to support this budding desire to ""trick out"" your space. I explored options that allowed me to hide almost every aspect of the traditional MySpace user interface and replace it with a custom page, an open source template I had taken from someone else and modified with my personal details. The personalized DIY web was still very much alive, albeit no longer on our own terms.  #### Selling the Farm  I believe it was in early 2005 when someone first asked me if I had an account on ""The Facebook"". The entire campus was poised to jump on as soon as it became available. Ostensibly this was seen as an exclusive space previously only held by a handful of elite colleges and universities. Within a weekend a shift had occured with the majority of campus now communicating on Facebook and MySpace becoming ""that other place"" that people kept up....for awhile....  Facebook was new and different. The convenience of connecting to people you knew from other classes or building was immediately powerful.  > Can you change the background image?  >  > Well, no.  >  > Can you change anything?!  If MySpace was the first of many steps toward giving up control, Facebook was a cruel slavemaster who made sure you were happy and fed, but had no interest in self-agency. We all got shades of blue and a set of profile questions to answer in order to define who we were. We traded personalization happily for the ability to connect and feel a sense of community that was immediate. This loss of control became all too real as the interface changed to provide real- time updates, a ""stream"", ads, and so many more elements that would each be decried by the community as ""the last straw"". By 2007 we had the option to go to Twitter and some did, but most stayed in Facebook (as if that mattered) as regions outside of higher education became available. And after all, Twitter was just another communication platform, but it didn't bring us any closer to that sense of personalization.  #### The DIY Movement Grows  Jim Groom at Northern Voice 2008 - Photo Credit Kris KrÙg  While ""Web 2.0"" was busy bringing us one silo'd platform after another and taking it away just as quickly, educators like my business partner and colleague Jim Groom had gotten a Bluehost account and were partying like it was 1999 all over again. Experimentation was happening with things like WordPress multisite as a blogging platform for a campus. This stuff wasn't easy to build, and yet it got so much better with every passing iteration that students and faculty were growing to see it as a great alternative to the central content management system.  Around that same time a group of smart folks involved in a hackerspace in New York had managed to build their own 3D printer as a model for offering them to a larger community as kits. For the next several years we'd watch the rise of MakerBot as a shining example of what I'd call a cultural movement towards DIY. Schools (including UMW) were embracing makerspaces under the umbrella of STEM learning. Mandates to grow STEM fields from the Obama administration resulted in grant funding flowing towards K-12. Suddenly coding was the cool thing to be doing, whether it be for the web or for a remote-controlled kitchen appliance built with a $35 computer the size of a credit card. Learning felt fun again and we started to feel that magic that comes from rolling our sleeves up and putting ourselves into a project.  The Makerbot Campfire - Photo Credit Bre Pettis  Something also changed dramatically with our interactions with those same companies launching startup after startup and growing into monolithic corporations. The luster of being a servant to Facebook and Blackboard started to wear off in real ways for a larger majority, not just with the Edupunk cast of characters. From Diaspora and Canvas to Known and Reclaim Hosting we're in a moment where distrust in that power relationship could serve as an opportunity to start defining our own platforms. Maybe the NSA leaks, Snowden, and Heartbleed were wake-up calls. Maybe it's cracks at the seams of higher ed's top-heavy administrative house of cards. Maybe it's just the hipster vibe of the times. But more and more it feels very real with teens opting for text messaging and Tumblr over Facebook and educators seasoned and junior alike soaking up the power that alternative platforms give them external to what they're provided institutionally.  Perhaps instead of a Web 3.0 what we're being given instead is a cultural moment where the rebellious teen years of the late 2000s have given rise to a more enlightened adulthood. The tools are better, we're less naive about the relationships we have with them, and we're still learning. I couldn't imagine a better time or place to be than right here, right now, connected to you all, learning a ton, and building our future for ourselves.  Here's to 2015. May we rise to even greater heights by lifting each other up and investing our time, energy, and resources in people instead of products. Cheers.  ""Eriberto P. Lozada, Jr.",Davidson Domains,http://digital.anthro-seminars.net/admin/davidson-domains/,1/8/2015,"Davidson Domains is a college initiative that provides every student with a unique domain name and access to open-source platforms like WordPress. This web domain can serve as a foundation for your online presence at Davidson and beyond; it can be used as an e-portfolio that can be shared with potential employers or graduate schools. You will be able to keep the domain and content after leaving Davidson, at a price that is substantially lower than many similar hosting companies (through Reclaim Hosting, a non-profit started by people from the University of Mary Washington).  Because we live in a post-resume world, having a digital presence is crucial to your future success. While social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Flavors.me, and Tumblr can help you establish a digital presence, you are bound to their constraints. Having your own domain gives you full control; you can use the domain to save the world, sell something, show off, or get a job. Once you have a domain name, you will then have access to cPanel ? a graphical interface that simplifies managing a website. From there, you can set up whatever you want! Popular open-source programs include WordPress (used by about a quarter of the world's websites), but there are many others that you can use. Tutorials are available on Lynda.com (which is free to you as a student ? register through lynda.davidson.edu) and there will be staff and media tutors for you to consult with as well. I am of course available to help you as well!  To get your domain, you will need to go to domains.davidson.edu, and fill out the form. But before you go there, you need to choose a domain name. The domain name doesn't have to be related to your own name; there are advantages and disadvantages either way. You can also try something that evokes your name, discipline, or research. For example, my own domain is thefieldworker.org (as well as thefieldworker.net), which connotes anthropology (but I re-direct these domain names to my Davidson website). Prof. Mark Sample, the head of digital studies here, has samplereality.com. I could have used fujilozada.com, but avoid names like www.fujirocks.com or www.pixiedust365.com and other ephemeral names. To find out what domains are available, go to a site like http://instantdomainsearch.com/ and see what's available. Once you have one that is not taken, then go to domains.davidson.edu and fill out the form.  "Jim Groom,"How Automobiles, Super Highways, and Containerization helped me understand the future of the Web",http://bavatuesdays.com/how-automobiles-super-highways-and-containerization-helped-me-understand-the-future-of-the-web/,1/17/2015,"What follows is a scripted draft of the presentation I gave Friday, January 9th at the OU TechExpo at the University of Oklahoma. Also, below is the abstract I was working off, as you can probably tell the two are often very loosely joined ??  > This presentation will explore the importance of providing students, faculty, and staff with an innovative, web-based platform for owning, managing and migrating the digital work they create over the course of their academic careers. What's more, this platform is not a vendor-driven product, but an ecosystem of open source applications that must be central to their critique and creation of the digital world. It's the backbone for a broader, curricular-wide push for cross-disciplinary digital fluency. In essence, the platform undergirding the pioneering work of Domain of One's Own at Mary Washington is the open web. More than a learning system or publishing platform, UMW Domains recognizes and codifies the importance of digital agency for each and every learner on campus, and provides the means of enabling this for each individual at scale. The impact of the global information network on our campus community is not imagined or inferred, it is intentionally designed and cultivated. Welcome to the digital liberal arts, and the emergence of the indieweb in higher ed. Can you grok the future?  This talk is building on, at least in my mind, the presentations I gave last year about Domain of One's Own and the reclaiming of open, personal innovation toolkits at the university ? all of which culminated in the EDUCAUSE Review piece, ""Reclaiming Innovation,"" I co-wrote with Brian Lamb (and Teddy Diggs ?? ). The argument was deeply rooted in the idea that much of the culture and technical possibilities undergirding the internet, and later the web, were part and parcel of academic culture. Begging the question why, over the last ten-fifteen years, have universities been in the odd position of buying back much of the innovation they've pioneered? There are many complex reasons, but we couldn't resist highlighting the untold harms of a crack-like dependence on centralized systems for teaching and learning ??  For this presentation, the focus was far more on the possibilities of reclaiming that innovation, and how so many developments both technical and cultural ? can we separate the two so neatly? Probably not ? have been pointing towards another moment in which conversations around ownership, privacy, re- decentralizing the web, etc. are becoming more and more common. This talk was my first attempt towards building a cogent discussion of just these forces, and what they mean for campus culture, IT infrastructure, and the web more broadly. It wasn't a complete failure thanks to the deep impact folks like Audrey Watters, Kin Lane, and Tim Owens have had my thinking about the limits and possibilities of edtech over the last two and a half years. Although, acknowledging all of the over simplifications, bad analogies, mixed metaphors, pig cannibalism advocacy, and technical inaccuracies are mine alone.  Part 1: ""The Web We Lost""  ""It's not about the technology?"" is a refrain you often here when discussions around the way technology is impacting our teaching and learning culture. And while it's often intended to resist the fetishization of tech, which I think is very important, it can often result in a rather uncritical dismissal of just how dramatically technology is changing the cultural landscape we are working within, and has been for quite some time.  To try and make this point I want to share a clip from Orson Welles's 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons. It's a film about the declining fortunes of an established Midwestern family, highlighting the social changes brought on by the automobile age.  Welles and Bogdanovich grocery shopping?  A few interesting points about this clip, it was framing this discussion about invention of automobiles almost 25 years after the automobile had been invented. And in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich years later, Welles had this to say about the film:  > You see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world  ?  almost one of memory  ?  and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the ""good old days,"" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it  ?  not only the family but the town.  This moment wherein a technology had such a dramatic change on the culture certainly provides an analogue to our own moment. 25 years after the invention of the web, we might still hear some of the very sentiments in that scene.  For all it's speed forward, is the web a step backwards? Has it added to the beauty of the world? Or the life of humanity's souls?   We might have different answers to these questions, I, for one, can think of many ways it has added to the beauty of the world and the life of humanity's soul, but as Joseph Cotten's character notes, regardless of what I thinkƒ.  ƒ.the web has come. Almost all outwards things are going to be different because of what it brings. It will alter war, and alter peace. Our minds will changed in subtle ways because of the web. Did the web have any business to be invented?  Rather than begging the question of whether or not the web should have been invented, I think the more interesting question is what kind of web do we have 25 years after its invention?  A question a number of people have been asking, one popular example of just this is Anil Dash's talk ""The Web We Lost"" at the Berkman Center in 2012.  > In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity. In this vision, you would own your own domain name and have complete control over its contents, rather than having a handle tacked on to the end of a huge company's site. This was a sensible reaction to the realization that big sites rise and fall in popularity, but that regular people need an identity that persists longer than those sites do  Audrey Watters, in one of her ten amazing top edtech trends posts, focuses on the IndieWeb (more on that anon) and quotes Arizona State University journalism professor Dan Gillmor on howƒ  > We're in danger of losing what's made the Internet the most important medium in history: a decentralized platform where the people at the edges of the networks  ?  that would be you and me  ?  don't need permission to communicate, create, and innovate.  And to quote Audrey Watters herself from her IndieWeb post:  > Image credit: Alan Levine  >  > The Open Web has increasingly become the Corporate Web, with powerful monopolies controlling key features like ""search"" and ""social,"" not to mention the underlying infrastructure that's always been theirs ? telecommunications, the ""series of tubes"" themselves. We have poured our lives into Internet technologies ? our status updates, our photos, our messages, our locations, our fitness regimes, our movie preferences, and more. We have poured our lives into data silos, where our personal information is now mined, the value extracted from it by companies for companies.  And even the inventor of the web himself, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, went on tour for the 25 anniversary of his invention to say ""it's time to re-decentralize the web."" He in many was calling for a bill of rights for the web:  > Unless we have an open, neutral internet we can rely on without worrying about what's happening at the back door, we can't have open government, good democracy, good healthcare, connected communities and diversity of culture.  Something Berners-Lee said during a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" last year that was particularly striking and came during his response to a question about whether we can preserve the open web. He noted:  > It is up to us. It is an artificial creation, as are our laws, and our constitutions . . . we can choose how they work. We can make new ones. Our choice.  Which is particularly striking for me right now because I just got finished watching the HBO series John Adams, which is all about this very thing. Creating the reality we exist within (as well as the deep problems of golden age history), and in many ways challenges Welles' vision of the automobile in The Magnificent Ambersons. It is not inevitable that the web will wreck the good old days. It's an artificial creation, and we can reclaim agency in how it works.    Part 2: A Brief History of Academic Technology  So how has academic technology worked at universities over the last 25 years? George Siemens, who so graciously allowed me to use the following frame for this brief history before its publication (big fan!), breaks it down into four stages:  1) Computer Based Training and Websites  2) Learning Management Systems  3) Social Media, Portfolios, and MOOCs  For the purposes of this post I am abbreviating the text/slides I include here. This section of the talk was taken from my previous discussion of the ~spaces during the 1990s, the rise of the LMS circa 1999, the mixed reception/adoption of social media for teaching and learning at universities throughout the oughts, the explosion of MOOCs in 2011, and the concomitant fallout.  4) Distributed, adaptive learning, and competency models  For this fourth stage I reframed/interpreted Siemens' idea of distributed and adaptive learning vision to coincide with part 3 of the talk, ""Reclaiming the Web,"" by discussing how UMW is the locus of an initiative supporting faculty, staff and students to re-decentralize control over their work. Domain of One's Own at UMW as the example. I didn't touch on competency models at all, but I want to revisit this in the next version of this talk.    Part 3: Reclaiming the Web  One of the immediate problems for setting up Domain of One's Own was thank it really hadn't been done before. This isn't to say it ""revolutionary,"" quite the contrary, it's trailing edge technology ? web hosting had been around for over decade when we were running our pilot. What was revolutionary providing any and all students, faculty, and staff their own domain, as well as an ""user innovation toolkit"" to start exploring different open source applications that they administer and control.  This is an example of the the GUI Interface wherein the community can control their slice of the server, one way of understanding this is thinking of Domains and web hosting in relationship to a house and street address [I'll spare you, dear reader, the awesomeness of this metaphor in this post, but you can explore it in all its grandeur here.]  And part of the power of such an approach might be see more practically through managing and controlling your various resources online. Something Jon Udell discusses quite eloquently in his 2007 EDUCAUSE talk ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology."" Using Gorden Bell MyLifeBits as one, extreme, example of someone who is archiving everything they have ? every ""lifebit"" is being digitized and made searchable. In effect, he will have a comprehensive digital archive of his life?not unlike The Truman Show ? although voluntary ?? Something which raides an important question, where are your lifebits stored? Who owns them? Do you want you digital photos, videos, writings, emails, etc.? Is that an archive that has some posterity beyond your own time here? If so, whose managing it if not you?  Gordon Bell's Total Recall  All of which dovetails nicely with a broader movement around these very ideas: The IndieWeb. and the best and most definitive framing I've yet to read is in this article from Audrey Watters, part of her year-end tech trends series. Essentially, the indieweb movement is focused on three principles:  And one of the ways at thinking about these principles technically, is through an approch they refer to as POSSE:  Or, ""publish on your own site and syndicate everywhere."" An excellent example of which is the IndieWeb publishing application Known, which allows you to post to your own domain, and push out to various social media sites like Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, SoundCloud, etc.  One of the founders of the IndieWeb movement, Amber Case, who I actually realized was featured as part of the new generation of scientists in, I believe, National Geographic while standing online at a grocery store (Don Delillo was right!). Her exploration of the implications of technology on our idea of self is really powerful, and pushes us to think about some of the deeper issues that undergird the control of who we are online.  > A self or identity that is produced through various participation architectures, the act of producing a virtual or digital representation of self by filling out a user interface with personal information.  >  > Facebook and Twitter are examples of the templated self. The shape of a space affects how one can move, what one does and how one interacts with someone else. It also defines how influential and what constraints there are to that identity. A more flexible, but still templated space is WordPress. A hand-built site is much less templated, as one is free to fully create their digital self in any way possible. Those in Second Life play with and modify templated selves into increasingly unique online identities. MySpace pages are templates, but the lack of constraints can lead to spaces that are considered irritating to others.  Andƒ  > From earliest times, humans had tools like hammers that extended our physical self. Today's technology extends our mental self. It's changing the way we experience the world.    Part 4: Web Futures and the Resilience of Transportation Metaphors or, an Epilogue of Sorts  Amber Case echoes the questions we started with in this talk. Namely, how are our minds changed in subtle ways by new technologies? How do they challenge or reinforce some op our assumptions about identity? Furthermore, how does this impact who owns our data? I could just as easily have ended this discussion there, questions that initiatives like Domain of One's Own are trying to engage by integrating digital fluency into the curriculum.  But one more thing before I goƒtransportation metaphors. While working on this talk I was struck by how well The Magnifcent Ambersons example with the automobile mapped on our own cultural moment with the web. What's more, the brilliant exhibit at the Smithsonian's American History Museum ""American on the Move,"" inspired me to think about the realtionship.  US 66 Sign from the Smithsonian Institute's ""America on the Move"" exhibit  The Information SuperHighway is one common metaphor, and for many it was the metaphor used to introduce the Internet more generally. The web being the interface through which it became visible. In fact, in Howard Rheingold's 1995 interview about the web on Frontline, this very metaphor comes up immediately.     And the transportation metaphors have persisted pretty consistently, take the following image to explain Net Neutrality. Even more compelling if you are from the Washington DC area given they recently introduced a pay-per-use toll road model for 40-odd miles of highway on the I-95.     In fact, it might be argued that the transportation metaphors power of explanation are in their immediate concreteness. Which might suggest why ""The Cloud"" is such a problematic, mystifying metaphor. Suggesting your stuff is out there ""somewhere,"" rather than being clear it is simply on someone else's machine, not yours. The cloud introduces an obfuscation of the concrete, material realities underlying this technological revolution, which is exactly what the IndieWeb, Reclaim, Domain of One's Own, etc. want to try and make intelligible.  Which brings me to yet another transportation metaphor which has been helping me to understand the changing nature of IT infrastructure right now. Docker, which explains its technology using the containerization analogy ? which revolutionized shipping over the last 50 years ? represents a powerful insight into how servers are becoming virtualized, portable, easier to manage, and potentially much, much cheaper. Not unlike what containerization did for shipping since the 1970s ? after they were standardized and the US Navy backed this method during the Vietnam War.    All of which brings me to my companion video for the opening bit on Automobiles. Here is Frank Sobotka from Season 2 of The Wire sitting through a presentation on the containerization of the Baltimore Port, and it's resulting impact on his union.  This talk is unfinished. But, fortunately, I'll have a few more attempts to try and make sense of it. Particularly this last part, namely explaining Docker, containerization, the changing nature of IT, and it's impact on edtech. But, I'll have to save that for my next talk.  "Marguerite McNeal,BYU's Bold Plan to Give Students Control of Their Data,https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-12-18-byu-s-bold-plan-to-give-students-control-of-their-data,1/18/2015,"As Web culture permeates the higher education experience, from Yik Yak conversations to collaborative digital assignments, questions of data privacy are gaining national attention. In 2015, 46 states introduced 182 bills addressing student data privacy, according to nonprofit advocacy group the Data Quality Campaign. These attempts to protect personal information treat student data as something to be managed and controlled ? but don't give students themselves a voice in how they want their data to be used. Jim Groom, who spearheaded the Domain of One's Own effort as director of technologies at the University of Mary Washington, thinks there's a better way. He's working with Brigham Young University (BYU) on a personal API concept that would let students decide what they share, with whom and for how long. ""We're building a system that de-centers the control of data, so that students can control their own information,"" Groom says. A personal API builds on the domain concept ? students store information on their site, whether it's class assignments, financial aid information or personal blogs, and then decide how they want to share that data with other applications and services. The idea is to give students autonomy in how they develop and manage their digital identities at the university and well into their professional lives. Domain of One's Own Since UMW introduced Domain of One's Own in 2013, more than 30 universities have followed suit. They're giving students and faculty domain names and Web spaces and letting them experiment. Users publish coursework, build portfolios or tinker with personal projects, for example. The idea springs from what Phil Windley, an enterprise architect at BYU, calls sovereign source identity ? the notion that your identity comes from within you and not from someone else. It's the opposite of what happens in many online transactions today. Facebook, Google and even universities give users identities, Windley says. When individuals share personal information with these services, their data lives inside the organizations' administrative domain and they have little to no control over what happens next. ""We want to teach students that this isn't the only way identity happens online. They can create their own,"" Windley says. This fall BYU introduced its Domain of One's Own pilot to 1,000 student and faculty participants. But offering personal Web spaces is just the beginning, Windley says. ""Domains help students understand their personal identity. The next step is understanding your personal data and how you control that."" Domains as Gateways A personal API radically changes the relationship between data owners and users. In the university context, it works like this: Students store their information in their personal domains and grant other sites and applications access to that data as they see fit. Perhaps they want an app to access their course enrollment data for exactly one semester, or they want to share only certain portions of their portfolio with their professor. In theory, a personal API creates a more egalitarian relationship between the person sharing data and the entity that wants to use it. ""It's the idea that tapping into one's data should be a negotiation that the student gets to make,"" says Adam Croom, director of digital learning at the Center for Teaching Excellence at the University of Oklahoma (OU). ""Why can't I manage what apps tap into my data, whether that's the learning management system or the bursar's office? Why aren't there terms and conditions for students to understand who has access to their data?"" OU launched its Domain of One's Own initiative, called OU Create, in fall 2014 and is also working on API programs at a system level. At BYU, Windley and his colleagues have been working on a university API, which will make the school's data easily accessible so that developers can build applications that use it. Now they're figuring out how student and faculty APIs could interact with a broader one developed by the university. BYU teamed up with Groom and his company Reclaim Hosting, which provides domains and Web hosting to educators and institutions, to use domains as the hosting platform for personal APIs. Reclaim and BYU will test personal APIs this spring. Once students have a domain, they'll be able to install applications that allow their data to talk to other programs, such as a learning management system. From their domain site, users will have the option to publish work and share data with different spaces, including social media and class sites, and control privacy settings to decide which other sites can access their information. From Data Owner to Arbiter A personal API linked with a domain puts students at the center of their learning experience. Windley says he sees the combination as a key to lifelong learning. In managing their data and taking their work with them well beyond their academic life, students become active participants in their education, rather than passive consumers, he says. As with domains, not every student and faculty wants to use a personal API. The project is as much about opting out as opting in, Groom says. He doesn't anticipate that all 30,000 BYU students will sign up for a personal API. Instead he says he hopes the project will provide a proof of concept that students and faculty care about using data in radically different ways to gain more control over the work and information they produce. ""It's not a final solution that should be pushed on anyone. It's a platform for people to experiment with, to control and manage and work through this question of identity on the Web."" "Sharon Gerald,A Domain (or a blog?) of One's Own,http://teacherlytech.net/?p=472,2/15/2015,"This is an interested talk about a university's push to get a domain name and web hosting for every student.  Two main points really struck me from the talk.  1. We want to give students a sense of ownership over their own web real estate and/or their own web presence.  2. We want to push students into discovering ""the deeper possibilities of the web.""  There are, of course, possibilities that go far deeper than the blog, but I do think that for students who don't have access to web hosting, a free blog account can be a good place to start learning deeper possibilities than can be found on social networking sites alone. Maybe a blog address is the community college student's ""domain of one's own.""  I wish that my school could get every student a domain name, but for now I will settle for requiring all of my students to register a blog address.

Some actually appear to have been designed with students in mind. But the data and work produced on them belongs to the institution. Finish the course, leave the school, and its all gone.

The papers advocates for an expanded parent- controlled profile that could include:     Expanded achievement data     Motivational preference (i.e., experiences that produce persistence and performance)     A narrative discussion of learner assets and challenges     A full portfolio of student work     A college and career readiness tracker     Habits of success tracker     Work experience history     Community service history   The Data Backpacks paper recognized that they key to embracing privacy and personalization is permissions and portability. The paper was aimed at K-12, but it may be even more important for postsecondary learners to be controlling and cultivating a portable professional profile.  A growing number of colleges encourage learners to launch and cultivate an online presence. Mary Washington University's Domain of One's Own is a good example. MWU pays for the domain while students are enrolled and students pick up the tab when they leave school.  Similarly, secondary and postsecondary students should have cost free access to a personal companion to the school's learning management system, a business to consumer (B2C) LMS companion that is a private portable profile. A permission system would allow the learner to decide what to share with whom.  The B2C LMS companion would have goal setting functionality like GoalBook, a cloud based portfolio system, and links to social media. The postsecondary version could feature financial data: cost to complete, aid opportunities, and payment schedule.  Portable student profiles are part of what Phil Hill calls the shift from a walled garden approach to an open garden approach that allows the coordination of the base system with external tools.  Professional schools hoping to support lifelong learning plans should have particular interest in the B2C LMS companion. They may offer to sponsor the portable profile app so they can recommend learning experiences related to individual development plans, certification requirements, and industry developments.  Rob Abel, CEO of IMS Global Learning Consortium, the interoperability folks, likes the idea of the LMS companion. Following is a picture of how interoperability guys like Rob think about a bridge to the institutional LMS (and data) and a much more effective ecosystem of educational apps outside the institution.  ""I've had that picture and various versions of it for at least six to seven years now,"" said Abel. ""We use that picture to rally some of the mobile- focused suppliers on the idea."" He's got meetings next month that may lead to a pilot project.  IMS supported developmental work on an Education and Career Positioning System  championed by Lonestar College System. At a community college convening, Lonestar chancellor Richard Carpenter challenged the audience of community college leaders to transform what colleges can do for students by enabling students to ""own the student record.""  Carpenter said that institutions need to help students understand opportunities, create and organize the artifacts from their learning according to critical competencies, and ultimately enable students to ""take this with them"" throughout their lives. (See feature on Quest, a great early college high school, a great partnership between Lonestar and Humble ISD)  IMS open standards can play a vital role in opening up the data and work product created in a variety of EdTech and export to the student record, ""The one owned by the student of the future,"" according to Abel.  The LMS market (postsecondary and corporate training) has revenues of more than $3 billion. A new category of B2C LMS companions could add another $1 billion to the growing category and could boost efficacy, engagement and learner satisfaction along the way.

It's a good question, and we talked a bit about making the tech more seamless. But Tim Owens pointed to UMW DTLT's latest addition, the Digital Knowledge Center (DKC), as one tremendous asset to scaling the work we are doing with UMW Domains ? and that is absolutely right.  Martha Burtis has done a brilliant job of getting her center up and running in the Fall. And there is no question DTLT's presence and possibilities have been dramatically expanded as a result of her work. Martha has built a center that employs eight student aides who are equipped to help the broader student community at UMW with everything from media editing to managing WordPress to navigating cPanel to editing images to using TinkerCad, and much, much more. In short, the DKC is a peer-tutoring center for digital projects that coordinates with faculty development to further support and scale the work we do on campus. Martha's recent post, ""Why Every EdTech Group Needs a DKC,"" lays out the various benefits the DKC offers a group like DTLT, and it comes highly recommended.  When we talked briefly about the work Martha is doing with the DKC, everyone around the table at Georgetown was impressed. Scaling was not framed as solely a technical issue, but a development and support issue. At it's heart, support and development is what the DKC helps us with when it comes to Domain of One's Own. A center like this enables students who have issues or questions about what's possible with their own domain and web hosting have immediate support and guidance from their peers. What's more, it enables us to provide support for entire courses for faculty who want to explore UMW Domains, but are concerned about balancing tech support with their teaching. This goes a long, long way towards scaling a project that is deeply rooted in a broader vision of digital fluency.  Katie Gach (who was one of Michael Wesch's Anthropology students at Kansas State) was at the table, and she was immediately taken by the idea. We talked briefly at the break about the DKC, and she suggested how such a Center highlights the humanity of the Domains project. The space where the support and interaction around this process of becoming digitally fluent was anchored, and that's a great way to think about what the DKC means to our group. I'm sure folks at Georgetown will be in touch with Martha, and I love that the question of scaling UMW Domains is not answered by a particular technology, but rather by investing in people and fostering relationships and conversations across campus. Now that's scale that scales.  "Jim Groom,UMW Domains Is Not Radical,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-is-not-radical/,3/5/2015,"On Tuesday Tim Owens and I spent the afternoon with the good people at Georgetown's Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS). Rob Pongsajapan invited us up to talk about the work we've done with UMW Domains. Rob has led much of the WordPress development for CNDLS over the years. In fact, six or seven years ago he came to UMW to talk about the work we were doing with UMW Blogs at the time. So it was pretty cool to re-connect around Domains. There is a consistency to the work we have been doing over the last decade, and that became increasingly clear to me during this short day trip. In fact, best thing about both UMW Blogs and UWM Domains is the number awesome people in the field they have brought us into contact with. Sharing our work with other groups is the best part of what we do ? and it has been one of the things that has made UMW's DTLT distinctive.  As I alluded to earlier, an interesting sense of convergence hit me while I was at Georgetown. I realized that CNDLS Executive Director, Eddie Maloney, was part of a panel Martha Burtis took me to back in 2006 ? she was a great director! The panel also consisted of Bryan Alexander and Dan Cohen, and it was titled ""Scholarship 2.0: What Web 2.0 means for Digital Humanists."" That's some crazy Digital Humanities history right there.  One of the things that really struck me during the panel was Maloney's vision of the portfolio as a digital notebook that could move seamlessly across and between courses departments, and disciplines. It's an idea that I came back to just months later right here on this blog while building UMW Blogs. I still love the idea of a digital notebook, it's how I have thought of the bava for almost a decade. So when I met Eddie for the first time officially, I was kinda struck by the history there ? although I didn't formally mention stealing his ideas ??  As anyone in higher ed tech knows, the digital portfolio has become something of a white whale. We're monomaniacally pursuing this all-encompassing monstrosity of integration, while at the same time we know it's so many different things to so many different people. UMW Domains begins to pierce the skin of that leviathan-like mythos by reframing who manages, controls, and ultimately owns the portfolio well beyond their time at university. Your domain can certainly be a portfolio, but it can also be an upgrade to your institutional ~space infrastructure, a platform for digital scholarship, an engine for digital fluency, a highly customizable alternative for courses spaces, and on and on and on. It's many, many things. It's Protean. But back in 2006, as Rob noted while we were getting some coffee, the idea of rolling out a web hosting platform and providing your entire community personal domains would have been a non-starter. The idea would have never gotten off the ground, and even in 2006 commodity web hosting was no longer new. It had been around for 3 or 4 years. Hosting was not radical in 2006, but the idea of it as a tool in higher ed was.  Almost 10 years on from that 2006 panel about the digital notebook at CHNM, we have folks from Georgetown's CNDLS and their University Information Systems (UIS) at the table, and they immediately see its value. They realize the possibilities, and they're mindful of the risks and potential issues, but none of those concerns seem to be deal breakers. I was deeply impressed with Peter Farkas, the Director of Educational Technology at UIS. His questions and concerns were on the money, while at the same time he got the immense possibilities of such an initiative. At no point during the afternoon did I get the sense that IT was an impediment at all ? and that speaks to the fact that ten years later the idea of a Domain of One's Own is no longer radical. In fact, it almost seems practical and necessary ? and that's a pretty striking shift.  And that realization is not limited to our time at Georgetown. Tim and I talk to many schools who are interested in a Domains initiative, and the conversations have rarely been about convincing folks of the value, but rather how they can do it for their particular context. It's become increasingly clear that the LMS will do what it does best: quizzes, grade books, etc. But it will never truly be a platform for personalization, exploration, and individual control outside the definitive and limiting confines of the course. A domains project provides personalized namespaces, easy web publishing, and a whole suite of applications (all of which are portable) for those that need them beyond any one course ? not to mention their time at university. It's not radical anymore, in fact, it's actually pretty trailing edge. It's called the web, and its been around for more than two decades, it's just time that universities start exploring how it fits the needs of their campus.    All GIFs in this post, save the first and last, are by Michael Branson Smith. I found them while randomly searching for eportfolio filtered through animated images. I should not be surprised.  "Jim Groom,UMW Domains Data through Spring 2015,http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-domains-data-through-spring-2015/,3/25/2015,"UMW Domains through Spring 2015  Mary Washington is doing a follow-up story on UMW's Domain of One's Own a year-and-a-half later. The occasion provided me an opportunity to start breaking down some of the data we've collected thus far. We got the data out of Banner thanks to Jill Ellington, who works in the enterprise systems group. We then imported that spreadsheet of data into the service Intercom ? I wrote about it previously here ? to help break down and segment the numbers to see how usage by class of student(i.e. Freshman, Sophomore, etc.), number of faculty/staff, active users, how many courses, number of faculty/staff, etc.  Also, we could break down the aggregate numbers to suggest growth over time:  Fall 2013: 389 Domains; 364 Users   Spring 2014: 638 Domains; 629 Users   Fall 2014: 1074 Domains; 993 Users   Spring 2015: Domains 1320; 1260 Users  And here is a segmented view of those 1260 users:  975 Active students (or 997 -bit uncertainty here)  154 Graduates (students who are no longer matriculated)  131 Faculty and Staff  Also, we had 10 courses using DoOO in Fall 2013 and 14 in Spring 2014. In fall 2014 we had 23 courses, and 14 in Spring 2015.  Domains by student's class year:  Freshman: 149   Sophomores: 206   Juniors: 244   Seniors: 420  Another interesting breakdown which reinforces what we learned the first year of the initiative is that juniors and seniors with their own domain outnumber freshman and sophomores two-to-one. Originally we thought we would roll this out to each class as freshman en masse over four years, but almost two years in we're realizing that students further along with their degree (and settled in a major) are far more likely to have domains. This is reinforced by our decision to integrate UMW Domains into specific courses and departments with certain faculty ? although that decision was made because students and faculty were not participating outside a curricular context.  One of the things that seems evident to me thinking about Domain of One's Own at this point in time is curricular integration is king and culture always matters. Thoughtful, well-supported faculty members and enterprising departments that can integrate a broader vision of digital fluency into their courses and programs will continue to drive the value of UMW Domains. Which, in my mind, means faculty development and support remain the gold standards to transforming our campus culture.

What I like about this piece is how it ties the ability for DTLT to scale a program that provides an entire campus their own domain and web hosting with the creation of the Digital Knowledge Center (DKC). This center, built and directed by the great Martha Burtis, has opened up new vistas for DTLT. Thanks to 9 ninja-like student tutors, we now have the ability to help students master a wide variety of digital skills ? including managing their own domain ? which has been a huge boon in our ability to carry- on with such an ambitious initiative.  It's important to note that the DKC is not necessarily dependent on UMW Domains, and vice versa. Rather, the establishment of the DKC formalizes a peer tutoring environment to help students dive deeper into the possibilities of a wide-range of digital projects, and a crucial one for our community at the moment is Domain of One's Own. The idea that every edtech group needs their own DKC is something that I would take to heart if I were running an edtech group ? which I am, and I have.  "Jim Groom,An Art Portfolio of One's Own,http://bavatuesdays.com/an-art-portfolio-of-ones-own/,3/30/2015,"Lindsay Coffman's Art Portfolio  Over the weekend UMW alum Lindsay Coffman wanted to know how to point her portfolio's domain to her Squarespace site. In fact, we got two different requests over the weekend from fine arts alum who wanted to do this ? does that make it a trend? They were both using WordPress, but found Squarespace easier and more intuitive. I also noticed Lindsay was using Tumblr as her art blog, which is very cool and could make for another cool mapped subdomain: blog.lindsaycoffman.com.  While I want everyone to manage their own piece of the web, I also have to recognize that's not gonna always possible or practical. Domain of One's Own should put students and faculty in a position to make an educated choice about which they want to do with their space and why, understanding the limits and possibilities of their decision. While helping Lindsay point her domain this weekend, it struck me how central a domain name remains to this experiment in digital identity. Lindsay can map her domain and subdomains on Squarespace, Tumblr, etc., and if and when she gets tired of those services, they go belly up, or she just wants something new, the domain remains the same. As long as the services have a viable exit plan for her data, the domain becomes the space that enables continuity and longevity of her portfolio across various iterations over time.  So, while so much of the philosophical push behind UMW Domains (at least for me) has been about reclaiming from silos and controlling your data, it's nice to see students also recognizing the value of pointing their domains at a service (or several) in order to aggregate their loosely joined work in a fluid space of their own that can change as quickly as the web.  What's more, this exchange helped me figure out how to map a UMW Domain to Squarespace, which is pretty easy. It also helped me start preparing to help students think about why they might want to move their domain to a registrar of their choice. This was a valuable exercise in understanding how some see the value of a domain name as far greater than their actual data, which may exist across several sites and hard drives in different forms ? whereas a URL to point it all to is fairly unique. A nice reminder not to be too sure of the singular value of anything.  As far as mapping Squarespace domains, students and faculty can do it fairly simple on UWM Domains if they like, they just need to go into the Advanced DNS Zone Editor:  And then add the values that Squarespace provides in their documentation.  Squarespace added something interesting to the process I haven't seen before. You basically have to add a verification CNAME to your DNS zone editor settings.  There are a number of students that realize the value of a website and their own domain, so much so that they're willing to pay Squarespace $100-$120 a year (minimum) to make it dead simple. Balancing the cost of fluency versus convenience remains a constant struggle for educators who want to help folks think like the web. But between simplicity and the bava, I'll take the bava every time.  "Jim Groom,API & Domains Summit,http://bavatuesdays.com/api-domains-summit/,4/8/2015,"On June 3rd and 4th BYU and University of Utah will be co-hosting a two day unconference around APIs and Domains in Salt Lake City. The idea is to join a bunch of folks who want explore how APIs can help to reshape IT services and infrastructure for higher education, a la the University API. In addition, Phil Windley thought it might be fun to marry this event with some of the Domain of One's Own work we have been doing at UMW and beyond. With Kin Lane kicking off the event, it will feel a lot like a Reclaim Your Domain event, so how could I resist?  I'm planning to continue my long and painfully slow education around APIs, as well as aide and abet anyone interested in exploring a Domain of One's Own project. In particular, how might such a project bolster a conversation around digital fluency and digital identity at your institution? How can we build a trojan horse like the e-portfolio to get it on campus? How might we start understanding personal web space in relationship to broader questions of privacy online and ownership in the digital age? I'm hoping folks like David Morgen at Emory University, Kristen Eschelman at Davidson College, Adam Croom and Mark Morvant from Oklahoma, and others can make it to share their own experiences ? as well as for a pow wow amongst institutions currently in the thick of running Domains. If you are serious considering a domains project, this event is an opportunity to feel it out and get some focused time to consider your options, ask questions, and even get a sense of the broader picture. See the eventbrite page, or reach out in the comments or via email for more details.  "Carrie Schroeder,Tiger Domains Pilot,http://carrieschroeder.com/tigerdomains.html/,4/20/2015,"Pacific students often enter careers where they are expected to analyze and disseminate information publicly on the web. Additionally, internet platforms are increasingly used for volunteer work, political engagement, creative expression, and community or interest groups. Tiger Domains: A Domain of One's Own Pilot will create a campus collaboratory for developing student, faculty, and staff digital literacies. The objectives of the pilot phase of Tiger Domains are: 1. Create a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) for training in web tools and digital pedagogies. The FLC will leverage existing faculty expertise in the field of Digital Humanities to expand opportunities for faculty and students. Campus mentors Terri Johnson of the CTL and Carrie Schroeder of Religious and Classical Studies will facilitate the FLC. 2. Provide server space and support to FLC and students for public scholarship on their own domains. These will come from Jim Groom's Reclaim Hosting company; Groom teaches and directs the Domain of One's Own project at the University of Mary Washington. Groom will come to campus for an onsite visit and provide remote consultation throughout the year. (http://umwdomains.com) The web tools will include installations of frequently used platforms such as WordPress and Omeka. All websites developed in the pilot project will be fully transferrable to independent domains and hosting sites if Tiger Domains does not continue past 2015-16. 3. Facilitate faculty development in digital pedagogy, student digital literacies, and public scholarship. The FLC will meet before the academic year begins to learn more about Tiger Domains and the web tools and to workshop assignments. FLC members will also have 3-4 meetings per semester to continue faculty development in digital pedagogies and support each others' work. 4. Conduct campus outreach on digital pedagogy and active learning. FLC members will showcase their work at one or two public ""Digital Carnivals,"" and their students will be encouraged to present their work at the Pacific Undergraduate Research and Creativity Concert in Spring 2016. 5. Host planning conversations among campus stakeholders about future wider implementation of Tiger Domains. Tiger Domains mentors, Carrie Schroeder and Terri Johnson, will host conversations between faculty, the Library, CTL, OIT, and other stakeholders about future wider implementation of Tiger Domains. Conversations will address the program's pedagogical benefits, required infrastructure, and sustainability. Become a part of the Tiger Domains Pilot Want to incorporate public research and writing, building a website, or curating an online exhibit into your class? Do you already do this and want to refine your pedagogy or share your experiences with others? Join a digital pedagogy Faculty Learning Community for 2015-16! Participating faculty will receive a $1000 stipend to develop an active learning assignment using web-based tools. Server space for customized installations of common web tools such as Wordpress and Omeka for courses and/or individual students and faculty will be provided by Reclaim Hosting. (Websites developed during 2015-16 can be transferred to private webhosts if desired; the FLC will also discuss the feasibility and advisability of expanding this project beyond the this academic year.) Technical and pedagogical support will be provided by Terri Johnson (CTL), Carrie Schroeder (Religious and Classical Studies), your fellow FLC members, and Jim Groom (University of Mary Washington & Reclaim Hosting) remotely and on-site during a campus visit. Funded participating faculty commit to planning meeting this spring, a one day workshop (likely in August), and 3-4 training & support meetings during each semester. Funding is limited. Please email to the CTL a brief description (a few sentences) of your interests in the FLC and an idea for active learning assignment(s) you might develop. We welcome inquiries from all teaching faculty on the Stockton campus Fill out this BRIEF FORM by April 29, 2015, 5pm. Questions? Contact cschroeder@pacific.edu. Examples of ""Domains of One's Own"" at other universities The Domain of One's Own project began at the University of Mary Washington under the direction of Jim Groom and has expanded to other colleges and universities across the country. University of Mary Washington Emory University University of Wisconsin-Green Bay "Jim Groom,Domain of One's Own and WordPress Networks,http://bavatuesdays.com/domain-of-ones-own-and-wordpress-networks/,4/22/2015,"I've had a pretty jam-packed semester, and now that it's almost over I feel the need to capture at least some of it. We ran our third Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative with 23 participants across at least ten disciplines and two colleges. This brings the total number of faculty who've gone through this program at right about 80. That's a third of our faculty. The intentional and consistent development of faculty, and by extension students, over time is the approach that makes this initiative more than just a numbers game to tout we have ""full saturation."" We're committed to scaling intelligently, while rolling out and developing a community around the immediate possibilities web hosting and a personal domain offer ? and that gets more compelling every year.  Case in point, this year my cohort, made up of seven of UMW's finest faculty (there were 3 other cohorts with 16 more faculty), got interested in setting up WordPress multisite installs so they could create a network of sites for their personal portfolios, course spaces, research sites, etc. The idea makes a lot of sense, but when we started this a few years ago I steered away from this option because getting your own domain and web hosting seemed enough overhead. This year that all changed. Everyone in the cohort was comfortable with WordPress (a remarkable fact in and of itself), so we could take the time to explore the abstraction of what a managing a Network of WordPress sites entails. Dealing with questions like: How do you manage themes and plugins differently? What are subdomains versus subdirectories? How can you syndicate between sites? etc.  The process reinforces the longitudinal impact of so much of the work DTLT has done over the last decade from the Bluehost experiment to UMW Blogs to UMW Domains. It also points to a progression in what's possible thanks to how much we have invested as a community and how much easier things have gotten since 2005. With the application installer Installatron we can have folks do a one- click install of multisite. After just minutes they can be up and running with dynamic, wildcard subdomains. That struck me hard yesterday while I was taking a faculty member through the process. I spent a couple of years of my life on this very blog struggling through that very thing back n 2006 and 2007, now it's a checkbox on an installation form.  Easy doesn't suck in this instance because we can spend our time examining what it means to manage a network of sites. For example, the benefits of various sites pulling from the same fleet of plugins and themes but only needing to run updates in one place. I felt like the discussions around the application(s) helped us work through managing online presence, creating an online scholarly identity, and taking a hands on approach to controlling, owning, and archiving the work they do online. I've been at it so long with WordPress that I sometimes forget how crazy the arch of faculty development at UMW has been. Just about any faculty member with 20 minutes to spare can create an infrastructure that defined my career path just 8 short years ago. Nutty.  Anyway, enough of that. Below is a quick rundown of how you can create wildcard subdomains within CPanel. Even that seems easier than it was back in the day of editing vhost files. I'm stealing the majority of this tutorial from Namecheap because they do a better job on it than I could. I just add my own 2 cents here and there, as usual.  This assumes you have already setup WordPress as multisite, as easy as the click of a button on UMW Domains and Reclaim Hosting.You will need to copy a line of code to your wp-config.php and then access Tools?>Setup Network to choose subdomains. After that, you'll be given code to copy into both the wp- config and .htaccess files. You can see a good tutorial on that process here. In order to create a wildcard subdomains in CPanel, you do the following:  1) Log into your cPanel  2) Navigate to the menu ïSubdomains' under ïDomains' section  3) Create a subdomainï' pointing it to the necessary folder ( you will need to specify the path in the field ïDocument Root' ).  4) Go to the menu ïAdvanced DNS Zone Editor'   5) Make sure that there is an A record for .yourdomain.com created and pointed to the server IP address ( it could coincide with the IP address of your main domain or ftp.yourdomain.com is pointed to).  6) Now you will need to wait until the propagation is over ( it should take N seconds, where N ? isTTL for this A record; you can edit it manually and reduce the number to speed up the process ) and then the wildcard subdomain will work correctly.  The final step I needed to do for the folks on UWM Domains at the server level in WHM is to reset the DNS Zone for the particular account that is installing a WordPress multisite with wildcard subdomains. This was the bit I got hung up on, but my server admin skills are getting better and better with every passing day. Soon I may even be competent.  "Jim Groom,Password Management Ground Zero for Digital Literacy,http://bavatuesdays.com/password-management-ground-zero-for-digital-literacy/,4/28/2015,"During the open infrastructure panel at the OpenVA conference in Virginia Beach this past Fall, Martha Burtis had a great little tear about how we should focus less on centrally integrated IT systems that hide complexity, and push towards loosely coupled systems that reflect more accurately how the web works. She went on to advocate that rather than endlessly pursuing the holy grail of single sign-on, institutions should we spend time showing their community how to use a password manager. It's a great, provocative bit, and captures Martha acumen quite nicely:  It's a moment I have thought about many times since, and while I was traveling during the second week of the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative this spring, Martha sat in for me with my cohort. She introduced them all to the password management tool LastPass, and effectively changed their digital lives ?? I am only half kidding. If you have worked with faculty or students regularly, you quickly realize how difficult managing passwords is for most folks. I often tell #ds106 internauts that the biggest technical challenge they'll face in the course is managing their various passwords, and it's absolutely true.  Password management tools like LastPass (we use that to collectively manage our DTLT passwords thanks to Ryan Brazell) and 1Password (we use that for Reclaim Hosting thanks to Kin Lane) have increasingly become essential to my regular web workflow. With the advent of UMW Domains (not to mention all of our servers for Reclaim) I have as many as 25-30 different logins for work alone. Remembering them is impossible, and storing them locally on my browser or in my keychain is not only risky, but they don't travel well (or at all) to other computers. Turns out learning a password management tool was one of the most useful lessons for me this year, and that was also the case for several UMW Domains faculty in my cohort, thanks to Martha.  I'm starting to think password management should be ground zero for literacy when it comes to managing your online world. It was immediately apparent how big an impact it made on faculty in the cohort. That might be why Kin Lane suggests your first step to reclaiming your online world is taking inventory of all your online services (as well as the logins and passwords) so you can actually begin to understand how extensive your online world is, and how much you need to start managing that presence. The lesson is both practical and conceptual all at once, it's a great way to start any conversation around managing one's identity online.  "Jim Groom,DTLT's Hurley Award Winner: Martha Burtis,http://bavatuesdays.com/dtlts-hurley-award-winner-martha-burtis/,5/22/2015,"The Great Martha Burtis  I have been remiss in mentioning that one of my favorite people this side of the Rappahannock, Martha Burtis, was awarded the 2015 Hurley Award. This award is presented to an administrative/professional faculty member who performs exceptionally meritorious service to the University; demonstrates strength of character; and maintains steadfast dedication to the University's mission.  Martha does all that and more. So when Jeff McClurken asked me to write a letter in support of Martha (he was a genius for nominating her), I knew it was going to be a long one. There's so many good things to write, and I think of her as my mentor during these past four years of DTLT directorship. What's more, Martha has been so central to every creative, crazy thing we've done at DTLT these last years ? I'm thinking here about ds106 in particular, Summer of Oblivion #4life. Despite the fact that so many folks associate me with DTLT's success because I happen to be the one who writes and presents about it most often, it's always been a team effort. And everyone in that team has consistently turned to Martha for leadership and guidance no matter our title.  Just this morning while we were talking with the good folks from Georgetown's CNDLS about everything from Domain of One's Own to the Digital Knowledge Center to the new Convergence Center, Martha can effortlessly articulate the inter-relationships of all these things like no one else can. It's truly a treat to listen to her while she unleashes her immense insight, wisdom, and strategic circumspection.  So, I figured I would share the letter I submitted below as a way to document at least some of her accomplishments over the decade I have worked with her at DTLT. Truly one of the most rewarding professional relationships of my life. I can't say enough about how central she has been to the broader transformation of UMW's digital culture, not to mention my own understanding of what it means to manage institutional culture.    Martha Burtis has been a primary driver for much of the innovative work that has taken place in UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT) over  the last decade. In her more than thirteen years at the university she has served in a variety of capacities from Instructional Technologist to Director to Special Projects Coordinator. Most recently she has become the founding Director of the Digital Knowledge Center (DKC), a new center within DTLT designed to provide peer-to-peer tutoring for students working on digital projects across the university. It is impossible to capture all the amazing work Martha has done for UMW in a single document, but it might be useful to trace some highlights of her service to give a broader sense of the impact she has had stewarding her alma mater into the digital age of teaching and learning technologies.  Martha defined the course of this group during the first experiments with commodity web hosting and personalized domains in 2004. Her willingness to experiment with open source applications and build hybrid tools to demonstrate what was possible for the rest of the group was a really powerful catalyst for much of the work to follow over the coming years. In Spring 2006 she organized and executed one of DTLT's most ambitious course development projects ever. She worked with Theatre professor Gregg Stull to completely re-design the department's senior capstone course to be an entirely online, digital portfolio that was managed across an impressive ecosystem of open source tools. This was one of the earlier integrations of WordPress into a course at UMW, not to mention various other technologies such wikis, mapping, RSS, and multimedia to name just a few. It was a level of web-facing instructional technologies that was radical for the moment, and it took a technical fluency, broader vision, and organizational acumen that is a rare combination in any one person.  Her work that semester made Martha the logical choice for director when Gardner Campbell left the university in Spring of 2006. Martha's time as director demonstrated another dimension of her talents: strategic planning. Martha proved to be adroit at managing DTLT's move from the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) into the Provost's Office, understanding our group's mission needed to be rooted in the academic side of the house. Our work was given a new sense of purpose and promise under Martha's leadership because we were encouraged to fully engage exploratory research and development with faculty during her tenure. The commodity hosting experiment burgeoned, and services like UMW Blogs were established. What's more, the idea for Domain of One's Own (a project she would manage many years later) was first introduced as a goal we would all aspire to over the coming years.  After the birth of her second child, Martha made the choice to work part-time as the Special Projects Coordinator. This era of her career at UMW demonstrated the group's continued reliance upon her keen advice and understanding of how we should navigate myriad challenges. This is also the moment of her career wherein she returned more directly to web development and programming for the group. She re-designed UMW Blogs on more than one occasion and did extensive plugin and theme development for this system. Additionally, she started working on more focused faculty projects with various professors to build research focused databases, such as Andi Livi Smith's Survey Database.  These programming skills along with her broader vision of the field and the university were brought to bare in some truly remarkable ways when she turned her attention to teaching the Digital Storytelling course at UMW ds106. Not only has she proven to be an amazing instructor of this open, online course, but she developed some of the most innovative parts of its technical infrastructure: the assignment bank and the Daily Create. These are two extremely impressive examples of Martha's continued commitment to making the integration of technology into the course a meaningful and relevant experience that models the open web, rather than siloing it off in a learning management system.  More than ten years later, Martha is still pushing hard on her remarkable ability to balance strategic thinking, technical prowess, and innovative approaches to teaching and learning technologies. Arguably the formation of the Digital Knowledge Center this past fall is her most impressive work to date. She has trained nine student tutors to support our student community on a wide range of digital projects, making DTLT's ability provide that much more support to UMW's academic community. Thanks to Martha, our group has built capacity to provide more integrated support for faculty and students alike. Which undergirds the very raison d'etre of what it is DTLT does, help the UMW community make the long, important transition into a digital learning environment. UMW could not have a better steward than Martha Burtis in this regard, and I can think of no one on campus who deservers the Hurley Award more.  "Jim Groom,Independent Teaching Networks,http://bavatuesdays.com/independent-teaching-networks/,5/26/2015,"In the wake of my announcement that I'll be going full time with Reclaim Hosting, more than a few folks wondered whether I'll be teaching in the future. This came as both a surprise and honor. I build my teaching around the things I am interested in, and I have been fortunate enough that UMW has let me try this on numerous occasions over the years with various partners.  Howard Rheingold commented, ""You are going to jones for students. I know that I am."" And David Kernohan echoed a similar idea:  > I'm thrilled for his new role with @ReclaimHosting but I'm having problems imagining a world where @jimgroom doesn't do teachingƒ  >  >  ?  David Kernohan (@dkernohan) May 25, 2015  I can't see I world where I don't do teaching either. In fact, of the list of classes I want to teach, only one of them (the Library of Congress Movie MOOC) would really depend on being at UMW (or at least in the area) for the full imagined effect ? though it could definitely still be done. The others, like the seminar about Italy during the Years of Lead, a course exploring Domain of One's Own, a refresher on Zombies and Copyright, or a fullblown cultural hist0ry of Sharks are still very much in my future.  In fact, with the work I've been doing with Zach Whalen on the Console Living Room, I started thinking the the 1980s course I talked about co-teaching with Dr. Garcia in that list post could be even more pointed than a whole decade. What if we had a course about a 16 weeks of a single year, say the Spring or Fall of 1984 or 1985. What's more, it would never happen in anything resembling a classroom. Rather it unfolds as a 16 week media experience of television, radio, cinema, etc. in a living room across roughly those same 16 weeks 30 years earlier. The idea was inspired by the broadcasting of 1980s TV Michael Branson Smith setup in the UMW Console last month.  Animated GIF from Atari 5200 ad thanks to Zach Whalen!So, rather than having a course where you talk about 1980s culture. You setup a framework (or a living room) that over the course of 16 weeks recreates a culture across the axis of television, radio, VHS tapes, cassette tapes, vinyl records, books, magazines, etc. Students (or anyone else in the community) could come into that living room and grab from a library of VHS tapes, video games, cassette tapes, books, records, magazines, etc. and experience those various bits of culture. What's more, they could watch TV across numerous networks and/or tune into radio across various stations. And they would blog and reflect on those various moments they experience, and the cultural assumptions of the moment. They could go there to watch together, do it alone, or explore and share back new elements of media from that moment. In fact, Zach and I have started the the initial TV programming of the TV portion at least.  This could be reinforced and framed by various readings from that year focusing on broadcast TV, radio, video games, etc. I am planning on doing research this summer around history of network and independent Television stations in light of the rise of Cable TV during the 1980s ? not to mention the explosion of VCRs. I'm intrigued by that idea, and that could be one whole part of this class that isn't taught, but experienced in a way other than a classroom. I love this idea. It's exhibit meets classroom, and I wouldn't necessarily need to be there to ""program"" it.  I can't imagine I'll stop having ideas like this, and you can teach classes like this anywhere. In fact, there has got to be a department out there somewhere who might see the opportunity of bringing in various folks to teach courses with an eye towards the long, diverse, and complex history of media and edtech. I've had an amazing experience teaching with folks like Martha Burtis, Alan Levine, Paul Bond, and Maggie Stough. And I want to teach with more and more people. I want to teach a course on radio with GNA Garcia, Noise Professor, and Grant Potter. A course 0n 80s cinema with Mikhail Gershovich, Scott Leslie and Martin Weller. A course on the technology of poetry with Chris Lott. A course on the history of edtech with Brian Lamb, Audrey Watters and Mike Caulfield. A course on the history of the internet with Alan Levine and Howard Rheingold. A course on Digital identity with Bon Stewart. A combined #Rhizo106 with Dave Cormier. A course on gothic tech with Bryan Alexander and Audrey Watters  ? and that's just spitballing it. These are all courses that could be done without me, and if I thought a bit longer I could come up with 50 more. Teaching is just plain fun for me.  That said, it helps (at least for me) to have a specific group of students at a school who are taking it for credit for consistency and focus, but that could parallel an open and online presence fairly easily. I guess all this is to say I think this move to Reclaim Hosting may very well free me up to teach even more through a ""ds106 network"" of sorts, and I'll be doing just that this summer with prisoner106, and again this Fall as a ""silent partner"" for Tales from ds106 with Paul Bond at UMW. Hell, I might even be teaching for UMW still if it makes sense, and I'll hopefully try out some of these courses. But there is no reason to wait on any one institution or MOOC provider warehouse, we should be doing this as our own independent teaching network of awesome. Cause that's what we are, and the teaching is one way to both enjoy it and push ourselves to think more deeply about what we are doing. Bryan Alexander said it better than me:  > ƒwe independents should form an alliance. Or a cult, a secret society, a union, a triad.    Years ago Larry Hanley was talking about focusing a distributed course across several countries on one specific year, I think it was 1977.  "Jim Groom,The Reclaim Code,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-reclaim-code/,5/31/2015,"As Bud (the great Harry Dean Stanton) notes after snorting a long line of speed in Repo Man (1984), ""Not many people have a code to live by anymore."" I couldn't agree with him more, and this seems particularly true in edtech where we seem to spend far too much time and energy searching for technological salvation through analytics, data, and scale. The closest thing to a code most ""innovators"" cannibalizing edtech proffer are hollow notions of disruption.  I've been thinking a lot about the Repo Code ever since Tim and I were talking the other day about our vision for the future. As we double-down on our commitment to Reclaim Hosting, we have to make one thing entirely clear: we are NOT EDUPRENEURS. If you label us as such, we will be offended. This word suggests we are trying to disrupt educational institutions. We are not, we are trying to support those who want to do cool things within them. That horrible word also suggests we are sitting on some big idea waiting for angel funding or VC investment. This is not the case, we WILL NOT be taking any VC funding from anyone for two reasons: a) VC funding is the devil's work, and b) we have a viable business model based on a trailing edge technology called web hosting.  What's more, how we have built our business over the last two years is simple: we have kept our prices and overhead very low and provided exceptional service. This is not ground breaking, it's just solid work. Work both Tim and I are really proud of. We're an independent hosting label focused on supporting education, but open to any and everyone. The notion of independence is very important to us because it means we are not beholden to any other interests but our own. I like to believe we are part of what I hope becomes a broader movement of independent edtech, ""green spaces"" for exploration, experimentation, and collaboration. We need to Reclaim Innovation from the corporate disruptors.  SO, Tim and I have come up with you might call a Reclaim C.O.D.E. to quickly delineate what we believe and why we are doing this.  Community: First and foremost, Reclaim was made possible by the various and variegated people in our community. Reclaim Hosting is part of a long history of experiments and collaborations: ds106, Hippie Hosting, Domain of One's Own, etc. Many of the people who use and trust Reclaim Hosting are the same ones who helped us build it. Moving forward it only seems natural that these are the same people that will join Reclaim in more official capacities as we grow. We will hire from within!!!  Openness: Tough term, it's taken a beating as of late for good reason: over used, under delivered. For us openness remains what it has always been. Share everything we do openly and freely. We will share all our work/code openly on the web. Our model is not some secret sauce code base, it's support and development to people who want to experiment with teaching and learning on the open web. The more we share it, the better it is for everyone, especially the people we work with! [One of the under appreciated laws of blogging.]  Decency: Unfortunately web hosting is an industry over-run with fear-mongering and bullying that is built into the very fabric of the business. Just take a look at Godaddy or Network Solutions, it's awful. We've done a lot to make the process easier, more decent, and honest (and we still have much more to do to make it even better). We won't prey on people's fear of getting hacked or manipulate their lack of understanding how certain things work. When you work with Reclaim Hosting, you will be treated with decency and honesty.  Education: Our strength is education. Not simply because we have worked in higher ed for decades, but also because the mission behind Reclaim Hosting is to try and educate as many people as possible about how the web works. Ask any of the more than 700+ folks who have submitted a ticket at Reclaim Hosting how that's worked for them. We spend time showing folks how to use this space to create something on the web. Reclaim Hosting is a community for educators to explore the web for teaching and learning, and it may be the best thing to happen to higher ed since ds106 ??  That's the C.O.D.E. for us. We have a strong value system we operate from, so you've been warned. What's more, we're not necessarily consultants. People ask us to consult, and we have and can. But I associate consulting with parachuting in and out telling folks what they need. That's not us, we have an ongoing relationship with folks once the come to work with Reclaim. Out core business model is built on providing web infrastructure for learning from the individual to the course to an entire institution. We partner with all of them to suggest how to use it most effectively. But not one and run, but, rather, over time. It's a relationship, it's part of a broader community of independent edtech. That's what we do, and it's pretty amazing.  "Jim Groom,A Personal API,http://bavatuesdays.com/a-personal-api/,6/5/2015,"Having just blogged about the overall experience of the University API conference I spent the last two days at, and I wanted to get down some of the more focused discussions and thoughts around how the University API might intersect with some of the work we've been doing around Domain of One's Own. First and foremost, what is a University API? Well Phil Windley breaks it down brilliantly in this post on the topic, and this is the pull quote for me.  > We'reƒdesigning and implementing a University API. The idea is simple: identify the fundamental resources that make up the business of the university and design a single, consistent API around them. A facade layer will sit between the University API and the underlying systems to do the translation and deal with format, identifier, and other issues.  BYU's Doug Walker provided an excellent overview of how they're designing their University API template in terms of URL structures and JSON. I came in and out of the conversation based on my limited understanding (though it's getting better), but the discussion followed the concepts discussed in this tutorial ? a work in progress.  This was an important session because it connected with the conversation I had with BYU's Troy Martin about the idea of a Personal API after the session I convened around Domain of One's Own on Wednesday. We got to discussing how domains can be understood within the context of the University API ? and this is where things started getting kind of interesting because BYU is running a Domain of One's Own pilot starting this fall. As Troy said, what if one's personal domain becomes the space where students can make their own calls to the University API? What if they have a personal API that enables them to decide what they share, with whom, and for how long. For example, what if you had a Portfolio site with a robust API (which was the use case we were discussing) that was installed on student's personal domain at portfolio.mydomain.com, and enabled them to do a few basic things via API:     It called the University API and populated the students classes for that semester.    It enabled them to pull in their assignments from a variety of sources (and even version them).    it also let them ""submit"" those assignment to the campus LMS.    This would effectively be enabling the instructor to access and provide feedback that the student would now have as metadata on that assignment in their portfolio.    It can also track course events, discussions, etc.  The Personal API, through a very focused use-case of the personal portfolio, provides the means for students to have greater control over their data. A de- coupled application running on their own server yet seamlessly connecting to the University's various services. A scenario wherein students can manage their learning in relationship to a broader University API. And the portfolio is just one use case, you can imagine a blog, resume, financial aid, transcripts, university applications and forms, etc.  The idea of controlling one's personal data as well as providing a platform for literacy became the prevailing ""why"" of a personal API during the conversations, and that was very cool. The how is to start small with a simple portfolio program that connects to some of BYU's APIs to see how it works. Doug Walker noted it might be a bit hairy because the idea of personal API in some ways resists any set structure imposed on a student's domain. I agree with that, and I think that's why you wrap some of that structure and basic framework for the API in a single application, like a portfolio, before trying to map out some kind of Personal API spec that every student must adhere to.  In some ways I am blurring two sessions we had on Thursday around the Personal API. The first was a broad discussion of what it means, it was focused around questions of how we control the permissions of our data, rather than hand that power over to others. There's a pretty free range set of notes from the session, but I think this was the groundwork for the session in the afternoon when a handful of us sat down and tried to imagine the basics of this portfolio. We pulled Tim Owens into that discussion, and I think we have a rough idea of what a very small piece of a Personal API might look like.  What's more, Kelly, Phil, Troy, hopefully Kin, and any other interested party are going to form a loose working group to hammer on this before the next University API conference in January 2016. I'm really looking forward to this idea. Not only does it deal with questions of student empowerment when it comes to their data, but it could also mean a whole knew way of allowing us, and anyone else with access to the data via the API, to imagine new ways of aggregating, visualizing, and mashing up the data.  "Jim Groom,The University API: an (un)conference,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-university-api-an-unconference/,6/5/2015,"> The University API & Domains (UAD) workshop covers topics on developing API's, implementing DevOps practices, deploying Domain of One's Own projects, improving the use of digital identity technologies, and framing digital fluency on University campuses, This workshop is focused on addressing current issues and best practices experienced in building out conceptual models and example real-life use cases. Attendees include IT architects, educational technologists, faculty, and software engineers from many universities. ? From Phil Windley's post about the event.  I spent the last two days in Salt Lake City at the University API inaugural conference. This conference is so fresh it doesn't even have a website yet, but it does have a Twitter account. I had an awesome experience, and spent some serious time locking in and thinking about APIs, which is something I've been trying to do for a while. I'll share some thoughts about this (un)conference in this post before I explore some of the ideas that surfaced and my thoughts about how APIs intersect with the work we've been doing with Domain of One's Own in my next. Capiche?  > Agenda wall from the 1st day of the #univAPI unconference. This is going to be good. pic.twitter.com/IUyQBcduMP  >  >  ?  Paul D. Eden (@pauldeden) June 3, 2015  The conference was relaxed, intimate, and intense all at once?is that possible? There were only 40 people, but we had 33 sessions over two days. We got to know each other fairly well, and spent a lot of time thinking and talking about APIs, but in a low-key environment. Major props to Heidi Nobantu Saul for framing and facilitating the unconference approach beautifully. It reminded me of the 2007 Northern Voice Moose Camp, just with fewer people. A lot of serendipitous discussions, in-betweeness, and conversational sessions. I also have to give major props to Kelly Flanagan, BYU's CIO, for creating a truly convivial and comfortable atmosphere. He's a remarkable person, bringing a sense of humor to everything he does. But don't let that lull you, he's spearheading what might be the single most important development in Higher Ed IT: BYU's thinking through and building of a University API for their campus, and beyond.  This conference was BYU's first attempt to articulate and share the vision undergirding the heads down work they've been doing over the last year to architect this conceptual shift. No small undertaking for what is a very large Higher Ed IT organization. For all the talk about ""disruption"" and ""innovation"" at EDUCAUSE and their IT organizational ilk, you're always gonna find the most compelling work on the fringes. If you're looking, I would train your eye on the work BYU is doing around the University API ? it's amazing on many levels. How do I know they're serious about APIs and doing this the right way? Well, look who they brought to keynoteƒ.  No, not me! The API Evangelist, Kin Lane, a Mather amongst evangelists (Increase to my Cotton?). He brought the fire and brimstone Wednesday morning, inspiring hearts and blowing minds. He is legend. I could listen to him talk for days on end. SO. MUCH. KNOWLEDGE. He opened up with an overview of APIs, and why they're the building blocks for re-imagining the ways we can collectively build the web, not to mention their implications for sharing, managing, and reclaiming one's personal data. He then spent the rest of the morning running sessions about the future of APIs, giving an overview of Swagger, and generally being a force of good. I feel better knowing he's out there. What's more, he set a tone that talking about APIs is not only technical, it's social, political, economic, educational, etc.  The fact that Kelly and Phil Windley brought Kin in to frame this event speaks volumes about their approach. They have been working with Kin for a while now to help them work through the shift to making BYU's data more accessible, malleable, and easily shared across campus via the University API. What could be more important for an IT organization? The University API conference is a space to interrogate how we create, share, and manipulate data across an institution, which means its relevant for just about anyone on campus. The problem is most people can't get beyond the acronym API, and I totally understand that obstacle. I would love it if in the next iteration we ran an API 101 track that helped folks both understand and wrap their heads around how APIs effect the whole university.  I also have to take moment to mention how much I admire and respect the thinking Phil Windley is doing more generally in the space of technology as a domain (his session on Blockchain and decentralized identity management was truly amazing), but specifically in thinking through the complex architecture of what this means for BYU both technically and culturally. I'll write more about Phil, Kelly, and several other amazing BYU folks in my next post on the Personal API, but for now let me stop here and simply say I'm truly thrilled that a high-profile institution like BYU is leading the conversation around APIs in higher ed in a thoughtful, engaged, and open way. I'm fired up for the next University API (un)conference that will be happening, tentatively, in January of 2016. I guess we'll know more once they get a website ? Mormon hippies! ??  "Jim Groom,On Maelstroms and Syndication Buses,http://bavatuesdays.com/on-maelstroms-and-syndication-buses/,6/9/2015,"I am preparing a talk for Thursday that revisits a journal article Brian Lamb and I wrote in late 2008, early 2009 for the Universities and Knowledge Societies Journal (RUSC) titled ""The Education of as Un-Artistƒor is that the un-education of the technologist?"" It's an unorthodox approach to an article wherein we acknowledge from the outset we have no ""synthetic theory"" of what we talk about. Rather, we offer a series of vignettes of then current work happening in edtech that we thought was somehow important, while resisting any sense of an organizing theory or principle to wrap it up neatly. The article abstract is pretty awesome:  > Two educational technologists and webloggers present a series of vignettes, contemplating the effects of modern networked communication on their practice. Recognizing their inability to construct a synthetic theory amidst the maelstrom, they curate a collection of observations and manifestos emphasizing themes of personal publishing, spontaneous collaborations, learning on the open web, and syndication.  In effect, we were creating a ""maelstrom"" of examples that we wanted folks to get sucked up into to get a sense of the chaotic nature of learning on the web. We highlighted what turns out to be a pretty interesting collection of examples, and I think we may very well be able to lay claim the first academic journal references to Massive Open Online Courses. Natch, we wrote about MOOCs before they were cool.  But, as I will explore in my talk on Thursday, so many of these vignettes are pieces that started to come together when a community of folks started to architect the online, open version of ds106 in the Spring of 2011. A ""space of one's ownÊ,"" class-based mashups, spontaneous connections, serendipitous collaborations, and the ever-venerable syndication bus can all be seen as the building block of ds106. Interesting how so many ideas that were percolating around this time, fueled by the excitement of EDUPUNK, remain exactly the things many of us are still working towards. A Space of One's Own was instrumental to the personal cyberinfrastruscture at the heart of ds106 that enabled us to imagine a syndication bus we can build around it. A technical means to manage a distributed network of folks that share the work from their own space to a syndicated course hub. Spontaneous connections through Twitter hastags like #ds106 make for serendipitous collaborations and an amazingly distributed course experience.  So, as I am working through this presentation and revisiting some fairly strident language like this on the Syndication Bus:  > The very logic of the LMS might be understood as a mausoleum for the internment of any and all possibilities for an individual to control, manage and openly share their own thinking with the community at large ? it is within these darkly sealed crypts that you will find the mummified corpses of learning.  >  > Alternatively, syndication buses represent a space through which individuals within a learning community can share their work through personal publishing platforms that they maintain ownership over. Rather than locking information into centralized systems, institutions should be designing a syndication- oriented framework that empowers its members to add their own syndicated voices to a larger, streaming conversation that can be filtered and visualized through semantic tags and categories.  I am reminded just how tightly we have begun to make syndication hubs work fairly seamlessly when it comes to ds106. For example, Remy Holden is having his students at University of Colorado, Denver sign-up for ds106 right now. He's using the ds106 tag template for his course as an aggregator for students' posts. And guess what, it's pretty seamless. They complete a form asking for their name, institutional affiliation, blog URL, feed, and Twitter handle, and it's all done.  What's cool is that for Remi's students have blogs on everything from Tumblr to Blogger to WordPress.com to Wix to self-hosted sites. Yet, they're all being added to FeedWordPress and syndicating into the ds106 site without major issues.ˆ On top of that, when they select the radio button associating the feed with their course at sign-up, it automatically tags all their posts for that course. Those posts are then aggregated to a tag-based template page with course specific content in the sidebar. This is something Alan Levine figured out, and it's really cool. All the posts for Remi Holden's class are now tagged with cudenver15, and they show up at the URL: http://ds106.us/tag/cudenver15  Alan added context specific code (and short codes) for the class tag which provide a quick, aggregated course page. Links to the syllabus, assignments, list of student blogs, how many posts, random comments, etc. It's an awesome template that a professor can decide to use, or not. Either way, it acts as an aggregator that they can take the feed for and syndicate the posts where ever they want. The EDUGLU Syndication Bus in full effect aggregating anything that has a working RSS feed. Booya!  I had to do a few backend copy and pastes for the sidebar code to create a dynamic tag-based course page, but I imagine that could be automated so that a faculty member fills out the course information form at ds106.us and much of the tag-based template page is automated.  Alan has created some amazing instantiations of the syndication hub for a few years now. And as I revisit EDUGLU and the syndication bus yet again in preparation for my talk on Thursday, I am blown away by all the amazing progress that has happened in this arena over the last seven years since we wrote that article. ds106 is a model for online course design that is truly on and of the web. And it was built by many people, and tells a story of collaborative, community-based contributions that offers a powerful argument for experience-based design that studies the action of the whirlpool that is the web and cooperates with it rather than putting it back into a box.  The mission has remained clear, despite all the distractions and hype. Create a technical infrastructure that empowers both faculty and students to become the sovereign source of their online presence for teaching and learning. While at the same time, enabling quick, targeted aggregation and syndication of their work within a broader community context so they can explore, discover, feedback, and share. The syndication bus #4life.

In a departure from traditional instructional and IT practices, these programs offer participants what Gardner Campbell termed ""persona cyber-infrastructure""  ?  all the tools and resources users need to launch and manage a broad range of websites, to create custom teaching and learning environments, and to curate and manage their online identities on their own terms.  In the Fall of 2014, several disparate institutions piloted programs inspired by the ongoing Domain of One's Own project at the University of Mary Washington. Each of these projects (CI Keys at CSU Channel Islands, Create at Oklahoma University, and DoOO at UMW and Emory University) gives participants full control over their own web domains and the ability to easily create and launch a wide range of websites. Users were granted access to powerful open source tools that allow them to create online portfolios, exhibits, journals, magazines, wikis, and other digital resources and publications for use in courses, the co-curriculum or however else they choose. These projects embrace the Internet as generative of learning, scholarship and the distribution of knowledge. They enable participants to create unique spaces for teaching, learning, publishing and connecting with others in the open public sphere of the Internet and outside the constraints of a closed Learning Management System. The logic of these programs is that offering users this control means allowing them agency and empowering them to make use of the world-wide-web to serve their own evolving needs as learners, teachers, scholars, and digital citizens.  This reflective session, will present lessons learned across several disparate campuses in pilots of programs that, in a radical updating of traditional IT practices, offer control of IT resources to individual users. We will present the various campus projects and what they might teach us about the broader implications of offering members of a campus community their own domains, web hosting, access to and guidance in deploying a range of web tools to create web spaces for academic and personal use. We are particularly interested in exploring models of curricular integration of these programs and the tools they make available to students and instructors.  "Stephen Downes,The EDUCAUSE NGDLE and an API of One's Own ~ Stephen Downes,http://www.downes.ca/post/64075,6/24/2015,"Michael Feldstein addresses ""the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative's (ELI's) paper on a Next-Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) (OLDaily) and Tony Bates' thoughtful response to it."" He also mixes in copious reference to Jim Groom and the Domain of One's Own project, because it's consistent with the ELI paper. There are three major arguments from Bates that he weighs in on (the wording is Feldstein's, lightly edited by me):    1. potentially heavy and bureaucratic standards-making process vulnerable to undue corporate influence.    2. LEGO is a poor metaphor that suggests an industrialized model.    3. NGDLE will push us further in the direction of computer-driven rather than human-driven classes.  His response to Bates is pretty much encapsulated in this slightly condescending overview: ""Folks who are non-technical tend to think of software as a direct implementation of their functional needs, and their understanding of technical standards flows from that view of the world. As a result, it's easy to overgeneralize the lesson of the learning object metadata standards failures. But the history of computing is one of building up successive layers of abstraction."" The thing is, in most areas, increasing levels of abstraction made it simple do do difficult things, but in education, increasing abstraction made it difficult to do simple things. And that's the core of Bates's argument, and I think Feldstein misses it.  "Michelle Pacansky-Brock,Reflections on Teaching in the Public Web,http://brocansky.com/2015/06/reflections-on-teaching-in-the-public-web/,6/30/2015,"Photo by Jim Brekke, CC-BY-NC-ND  This semester marks two milestones in my teaching career. First, I am stepping away from teaching the History of Photography online at Mt. San Jacinto College, a community college in California, and will be team teaching a critical thinking course for transfer students at CSU Channel Islands with my colleague, Jill Leafstedt. Our class will be a blended format with Jill on- site at CI and me in a remote role. Secondly, Jill and I will be using WordPress to create our course and our students will create their own blogs in CI Keys. CI Keys originated last year as a pilot project at CSU Channel Islands, inspired by a keynote presentation Jim Groom delivered at ET4Online 2014, Reclaiming Learning: A Domain of One's Own (his presentation starts at 6:37).  This change is significant for me, as it represents a move away from teaching with tools that construct a secured ""shell"" in which students contribute and interact, toward facilitating learning in the public web (the Keys). In this post, I reflect on how this shift is significant to me, in my teaching role as well as my faculty support role, and examine the influences that have shaped my choices to use particular tools over time.  I started teaching online in 2003 and, at the time, Blackboard was the only tool I used. In 2007, the year I started this blog, I began to incorporate the use of tools outside of Blackboard into my class. This decision was driven by my desire to make my students' learning relevant, active, and inclusive. This core value has not changed for me. However, over the years, the tools I teach with have fluctuated. As I reflect on this topic, I recognize a growing gap between my ""espoused theory"" and my ""theory-in-use,"" two theories of action from the work of Chris Argyris, explained in the quote below:  > ""When someone is asked how he would behave under certain circumstances, the answer he usually gives is his espoused theory of action for that situation. This is the theory of action to which he gives allegiance, and which, upon request, he communicates to others. However, the theory that actually governs his actions is this theory-in-use"" (Argyris and Sch?n 1974: 6-7).  Argyris' work points out that the actions of individuals are guided by mental maps that inform what we think, feel, and choose to do. Most people do not recognize the impact of these mental models on their actions and, as a result, can be unaware when a significant gap develops between an espoused theory and a theory-in-use. These concepts can be applied at an individual level, as well as an organizational level. As I look back over the past 8 year or so, I recognize a gap between the values I set for my teaching and my actions.  A few years into in my online teaching career, around 2007, I started using blogs with my students. I was quickly intrigued by the potential blogs held to engage students in reflection, stimulate peer-to-peer communications, and engage students with an authentic platform for their ideas. The possibility of students engaging with individuals outside of our class in their formal learning environment was fascinating to me.  However, I recall being aware that everyone did not shared my utopian view of blogs. There were many questions around whether using blogs in a public web environment were acceptable. . . Was it ok to have students create accounts on external sites? Was it permissible to have student work be shared openly on the web? What if students encountered unethical interactions with someone outside the class on their blog? And how could I be sure my students wouldn't share inappropriate photos or write about irrelevant topics? I recall these questions making me uncomfortable. I did not have answers to them and neither did my fellow faculty or administrators.  After a year, I stopped using Blogger and began having my students blog inside a closed social networking tool called Ning (which was free to educators at the time). I didn't make the change because something concerning had occurred. Quite the contrary, I received very positive feedback from students about their blogging experiences. Ning is a tool outside the LMS, just like Blogger, however, the password protected wall it provided between the general public and the work of my students made me feel more comfortable. Honestly, I also found it easier to manage the content, as well, as it had been tricky to connect 30-40 separate Blogger URLs each term.  And that, right there, is my point. That choice to move to Ning has stuck with me  ?  for seven years. This past semester I still used Ning in my online class. As my choice to teach in a protected shell, albeit not an LMS, stayed consistent, my perspectives about preparing students for a mobile, digital society through authentic learning experiences became stronger. In 2013, I wrote these words in a blog post for EdCetera (reposted here on GetSmart):  > ""By designing our courses to have students use social technologies in support of active learning pedagogy, students will be encouraged to participate in the open, social web as they complete their formalized educational experiences.""  We all have espoused theories about teaching and learning. What are yours? It's important to pause and critically reflect on how your values relate to your actions. I really did believe the learning environment in my class was preparing students to participate in the open, social web. But was I right? Over the years, I grew more skeptical of this as social media began to penetrate mainstream life. The fundamental question I am left with is, ""How can students hone the skills to manage their digital identity when they're interacting in a password protected shell?"" I don't believe they can.  When students leave college, they are expected to be able to demonstrate how they are unique from other new college graduates. Participating in the open web during college can provide a scaffolded entry into the job market. Blogging in the public web remains a powerful opportunity for students to develop digital citizenship, as well as reflect deeply on their passions, skills, and overall place in this world. When students engage in what David Wiley has described as ""non-disposable activities,"" they are empowered to look back at where they've been, see their growth, and use their work to demonstrate their skills.  So, while there still are no concrete answers to those big, scary questions that plagued me years ago, I now believe that's ok. In fact, I know believe it's critical to engage with teaching in the open web to facilitate dialogue around these questions. If we all step back into our shells, we can't prepare our students to swim in the ocean on their own.  Finally, I recognize that the CI Keys project at CSU Channel Islands empowers me, as an instructor, to teach how I believe I should be teaching (while I also credit Laura Gibbs, whose innovations and willingness to share continue to inspire me!). The projects and/or tools an organization chooses to support can influence the flow of innovation in higher education. The flow of innovation is less dynamic when faculty are experimenting alone in the shadows of an organization.  References:  Argyris, C., & Schon, D.

His effective evocation of the early days of the ""tilde space"" struck a chord with me, and suggested that making it easy for faculty and students to have an online space that was fully under their control might be a solution to the frustration that some faculty on my campus have had using the LMS and similar tools. By the time we were halfway out of the room we said ""hey, we should do this, we can do this!"" and then found Gerry Hanley from the Cal State Chancellor's Office who promised to support us with seed money.  Just a few months later we had created and launched CIKeys as a ""laboratory"" for CSU Channel Islands. It was truly a ""Field of Dreams"" project - build it, and believe that someone will come. And it was definitely a pilot - we tried to make it clear to everyone who is involved that this was an experiment, a laboratory to try something out, with no long term commitment that it would continue. Sometimes you do the research and the planning and build a service with the confidence that the campus wants and needs it and will use it - and sometimes you just have a hunch that it will work for someone, so you try it out. (The first project I did like that was connecting my campus to the Internet in 1990...)  Well, come they did. A dozen faculty and hundreds of students have created 400 sites. (This is on a campus with just over 100 full-time faculty and 5000 students, so these numbers are significant.) A dozen more faculty spent 2 days in our faculty space learning about CI Keys so they could incorporate it into their Fall courses. And now, we're committed to supporting it and taking it as far as we can. You can learn a lot about what people are actually doing with CI Keys, and how it impacts faculty and students, from Michelle Pacansky- Brock, Jill Leafstedt, and Jamie Hoffman. We agreed we'd each publish a blog post about CI Keys simultaneously and see what we come up with.  Here's a few things I've learned (or relearned):    1. Follow your heart. Sometimes it's worth trying something just because it seems like a good idea, even if you don't know how it will work.   2. Pilots can be a good idea. If you don't really know whether or how something will be used, trying it out a low cost and low scale CAN be useful, despite some doubts. Some pilots fail because they are bad ideas - nice to find that out quickly and cheaply rather than launching a complete campus-wide service and then finding out. Worse, if your expensive campus-wide service is a failure, there's a strong temptation to claim it's a success and try to force it down people's throats. After all, you made that investment, it's too big to fail! Yes, scaling up can be hard, but there's still a place for pilots and organic evolution of services. (And see 4 & 5 below- scaling up can be a whole lot easier than it used to be!)   3. Question the curve. I am coming to question the usefulness of the innovation diffusion curve in Ed Tech. First of all there's an implicit value judgment that early adopters are better than late adopters - not to mention the infamous laggards. Not all technology adoption is useful, to say the least, and some is downright harmful. Second, why is success measured as universal adoption? If 20% of the faculty at my campus find CI Keys to be a useful and even transformational tool for encouraging student learning, does that necessarily mean that the other 80% are missing something by not using it? Perhaps, but I'm not so sure. It's nice to think that we can provide a single tool for everyone to use but we can see where that's gotten us. Instead, some will use institutional tools, some will use open source, some will use commercial tools, and faculty and students will use different tools (really, media) to accomplish different things. Is that hard from an ed tech support position? No doubt! But I think that's the world we live in, not one where we always think in terms of scale-up and universal adoption - that ship has sailed.   4. Use the cloud. Cloud computing can make innovation a lot cheaper and faster! It was very easy for us to work with Reclaim Hosting to launch this environment - thanks Jim & Timmy! There was almost no ""IT"" work involved, except for...   5. Single-Sign On always wins. By tying CI Keys to our Shibboleth environment, there's no need to create new ID's or provision service on CI Keys - a new user just uses their campus login and they can launch or access their CI Keys space. Instant scale-up! So that was the main IT investment - and it was just a few hours to set it up and test it.  That's my perspective from the second floor. Be sure to read what Michelle, Jill, and Jaimie have to say about the impact on teaching and learning - that's what really matters. (I promised I would post my reflections before reading theirs - I can't wait to see what they have to say!) I'm just glad that a hunch and a little support from the CSU Chancellor's Office has paid off big-time. Thanks to the entire team, including my partner-in-crime Chris Mattia who has moved on to other ventures but was instrumental in creating CI Keys, and who came up with the name.

Leafstedt,Connected Learning Spaces with CI Keys,http://jleafstedt.com/uncatergorized/connected-learning-spaces-with-ci-keys/,6/30/2015,"""All I need in order to teach is the students. I can design the rest.""  -Teacher Educator 1992  image by Jerry Bowley  When I was earning my teaching credential, one of my instructors said the above quote to our class and it has stuck with me. Her comment helped instill in me a my longstanding belief that teachers matter. Through years of teaching in K-12 and higher education, I have fought back against the idea of there being a single curriculum or a single textbook that will improve learning for all. I have always believed the curriculum and methods should be fluid and responsive to the individual differences of the learners and teachers. I brought this philosophy with me as I leapt into the world of educational technology. Unfortunately, I was hit with a wall of products and tools, mainly the LMS, that wanted to force the way I taught. The tools reminded me of scripted curriculums that were mismatched with learners needs. The tools attempted to overly structure my teaching in a manner that didn't allow me to be responsive to students in the online environment. They also kept my teaching behind a closed door when what I really wanted was to be teaching on the playground. As a teacher educator, I wanted my students to be able to return to the course content after the course was over. I didn't want access to the ideas and resources developed during class to go away just because the artificial end of their learning experience had come. This past year, our team at CSU Channel Islands (CI) piloted a project that addressed many of these concerns. We removed barriers, took away locked doors and created an open space for educators and students alike.  I am referring to our CI Keys project, an effort to provide connected learning spaces for faculty and students. We began this effort after being insprired by Jim Groom's Keynote, Reclaim Learning, at the Emerging Technologies 4 Online Learning Conference (April, 2014). In the fall of 2014, we began CI Keys as a pilot providing domains and web spaces to members of the CI community. Our goal was broad, provide an open, online space for faculty and students to explore, develop, and create with no barriers. We wrote no rules, we merely opened the door to the playground. The first year of the project has been an overwhelming success. Faculty and students alike are enthusiastic about the freedom and flexibility CI Keys has provided. Removing the structures and constraints of the tools we normally offer has allowed for ideas to flourish. We have seen program sites pop-up as well as e-portfolios, open courses, student project sites and more. The below quote from a faculty member at CI summarize what many are feeling. This instructor used WordPress via CI Keys to develop an open, connected learning space for her courses. In the quote you get a sense of how personal and interactive her course was after moving into the unrestricted, online environment. ""I love and hate that much of my course this semester is a ïone-time' event ƒ since I want to recreate the positive experience my current students are having, I won't just copy the course materials and update, like I might in Blackboard. ƒI have students that are so excited about blogging, creating a digital identity, and the course site, they have said the course has come alive for them.""   At the closing of our first year with CI Keys I am filled with wonder and excitement about what Year 2 will bring. Thank you to those that continue to inspire and support our efforts!

Chris Collins (@ChrisInDurham) May 12, 2015  I was excited to see Tony Hirst retweet the news that Duke University's website is being run in a Docker environment, and it could even be served through Amazon Web Services. Chris Collins, senior Linux admin at Duke, wrote about ""Using Docker and AWS to Survive an Outage"" they had as a result of DDoS attacks on their main site back in January. I love the way he tells the story:  > While folks were bouncing ideas around on how to bring the site up again while still struggling with the outage, I mentioned that I could pretty quickly migrate the site over to Amazon Web Services and run it in Docker containers there. The higher-ups gave me the go-ahead and a credit card (very important, heh) and told me to get it setup. The idea was to have it there so we could fail over to the cloud if we were unable to resolve the outage in a reasonable time.  >  > TL;DR ? I did, it was easy, and we failed over all external traffic to the cloud. Details below.  He goes on to describe his process in some detail, and it struck me how the shift in IT infrastructure is moving, and also made me wonder how many IT organizations in higher ed are truly rethinking their architecture along these lines. It's one thing to push your services to a third party vendor that hosts all your stuff, it's all together different to bring in a team that understands and is prepared to move a university's infrastructure into a container-based model that can be hosted in the cloud. Not to mention what this might soon mean for personal options, and a robust menu of teaching and learning applications heretofore unimaginable. This would make the LAMP environment options Domain of One's Own offers look like Chucky from Child's Play ??  I know Tim and I are looking forward to thinking about what such a container- based architecture might means for an educational hosting environment that is simple, personalized, and expansive. Tim turned me on to Tutum recently, which starts to get at the idea of a personalized cloud across various providers ? something Tim Klapdor gets at brilliantly:  > MYOS is very much the model the Jon Udell laid out as ""hosted life bits"" ? a number of interconnected services that provide specific functionality, access and affordances across a variety of contexts. Each fits together in a way that allows data to be controlled, managed, connected, shared, published and syndicated. The idea isn't new, Jon wrote about life bits in 2007, but I think the technology has finally caught up to the idea and it's now possible to make this a reality in very practical way.  His post on the topic deserves a close reading, and it's the best conceptual mapping of what we might build I have read yet. I wanna help realize this vision, and I guess I am writing about Duke University's move to Docker because it suggests this is the route Higher Ed IT will be moving towards anyway (sooner or later ? which could be a long later for some ?? ). Seems we might have an opportunity to inform what it might look like for teaching and learning from the ground floor. It's not a given it will be better, that will depend upon us imagining what exactly a teaching and learning infrastructure might look like. Tim Klapdor has provided one of the most compelling visions to date, building on Jon Udell's thinking, but that's just the beginning.  "John Stewart,OU Create,http://www.johnastewart.org/dh/ou-create/,7/9/2015,"This post was written as part of Keegan Long-Wheeler's Mobile Blogging Workshop series in response to his prompt: What campus resource has been most helpful to you and/or your work this year?  Create.ou.edu, as the website says, ""provides domain names and web space to members of the OU community, encouraging individuals to explore the creation and development of their digital identities."" Rather than settling for the LMS and the generic web presence that we, as academics, have become accustomed to, Create provides a very simple yet extremeley powerful room of one's own. The ability to freely develop Drupal sites, write D3 visualizations, experiment with JavaScript, host a blog and generally play in the open web has opened new avenues in my research and teaching.  When I first came to OU as an undergraduate in 2002, I was given a student page. This subdirectory of a subdirectory could handle html files and provided each student with 2mb of space. While this was adequate for hosting gifs of dancing babies or writing static fan pages for Buffy, it was already dated, and it was uselessly obsolete by 2006 when I graduated.  In the first year of graduate school, I tried to build an online journal based on Drupal's Open Journal System installation. I asked the IT department for domain space or at the very least the ability to run a php based site with a database. My request was not immediately denied, because no one seemed to understand what I was even asking for. The concept of a student or even a faculty member or department requesting space on the Universitiy's site to run an app was literally unthinkable in that it had not been thought of. I was referred up the chain of IT for weeks without ever running into anyone who understood why I needed virtual server space, database access, shell access, or anything else beyond an ftp connection. Eventually, I gave up, signing up instead for a site served from then ubiquitous Bluehost corporate servers.  After wandering through the desert, building websites on my own time and own dime for six years, I was offered salvationƒ.or rather a place in a pilot program for the OU adaptation of Jim Groom's Domain of One's Own project. Adam Croom, having just recently joined the Center for Teaching Excellence, had invited Jim Groom to OU to present on the concept and technical feasability of offering students and faculty domain space. As part of the workshop, we were allowed to sign up for a domain and given 1gb of server space. The service also provided one click installs of WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, WikiMedia, and dozens of other apps.  After 10 years of waiting, I now had access and support to build my own site and to populate it with subdomains and subdirectories to my heart's content. This site now supports a couple of linked subdomains alogn with another ten experimental subdomains with installations of WordPress and Drupal. I am currently building two courses in WordPress, a research database in Drupal, a developmental version of another research database in Drupal, and experimental apps for colleagues on this campus and beyond. Create is not a cutting edge tool or technology, but rather a means of access to a trailing edge technology that academics forgot about. It provides the means to return to a time when we, as academics, built the web and used it for open communication about research, pedagogy, and most importantly, our cats.  ### Share this:     Email    Facebook    Twitter    Google    Pocket      "Audrey Watters,The Web We Need to Give Students,https://medium.com/bright/the-web-we-need-to-give-students-311d97713713#.2ykccqiyr,7/15/2015,"Student privacy has become one of the hottest issues in education, with some 170 bills proposed so far this year that would regulate it. These legislative efforts stress the need to protect students when they're online, safeguarding their data from advertisers as well as from unscrupulous people and companies. There's some pushback against these proposals too, with arguments that restrictions on data might hinder research or the development of learning analytics or data-driven educational software. But almost all arguments about student privacy, whether those calling for more restrictions or fewer, fail to give students themselves a voice, let alone some assistance in deciding what to share online. Students have little agency when it comes to education technology? ? ?much like they have little agency in education itself. The Domain of One's Own initiative at University of Mary Washington (UMW) is helping to recast the conversation about student data. Instead of focusing on protecting and restricting students' Web presence, UMW helps them have more control over their scholarship, data, and digital identity. The Domains initiative enables student to build the contemporary version of what Virginia Woolf in 1929 famously demanded in A Room of One's Own? ? ?the necessity of a personal place to write. Today, UMW and a growing number of other schools believe that students need a proprietary online space in order to be intellectually productive. As originally conceived at the Virginia liberal arts university, the Domains initiative provides students and faculty with their own Web domain. It isn't simply a blog or a bit of Web space and storage at the school's dot-edu, but their own domain? ? ?the dot com (or dot net, etc) of the student's choosing. The school facilitates the purchase of the domain; it helps with installation of WordPress and other open source software; it offers both technical and instructional support; and it hosts the site until graduation when domain ownership is transferred to the student. And then? ? ?contrary to what happens at most schools, where a student's work exists only inside a learning management system and cannot be accessed once the semester is over? ? ?the domain and all its content are the student's to take with them. It is, after all, their education, their intellectual development, their work. Intellectual productivity on the Web looks a bit different, no doubt, than it did at Woolf's writing desk. But there remains this notion, deeply embedded in Domain of One's Own, that it is important to have one's own space in order to develop one's ideas and one's craft. It's important that learners have control over their work? ? ?their content and their data. In a 2009 article that served as a philosophical grounding of sorts for the initiative, Gardner Campbell, then a professor at Baylor University, called for a ""personal cyberinfrastructure"" where students: not only would acquire crucial technical skills for their digital lives but also would engage in work that provides richly teachable momentsƒ. Fascinating and important innovations would emerge as students are able to shape their own cognition, learning, expression, and reflection in a digital age, in a digital medium. Students would frame, curate, share, and direct their own ïengagement streams' throughout the learning environment. In developing this ""personal cyberinfrastructure"" through the Domain of One's Own initiative, UMW gives students agency and control; they are the subjects of their learning, not the objects of education technology software. Having one's own domain means that students have much more say over what they present to the world, in terms of their public profiles, professional portfolios, and digital identities. Students have control over the look and feel of their own sites, including what's shared publicly. This means they have some say? ? ?although not complete? ? ?over their personal data, and in turn they begin to have an understanding of the technologies that underpin the Web, including how their work and their data circulate there. At the simplest level, a Domain of One's Own helps students build their own digital portfolio. They can be used in a classroom setting in order for students to demonstrate their learning. These portfolios can contain text, images, video and audio recordings, giving students opportunities to express themselves in a variety of ways beyond the traditional pen-and-paper test or essay. One student uses her domain to showcase her artwork. Another chronicled her semester abroad. A third student has built a living CV, highlighting her academic research as well as her work experience. Since UMW launched Domain of One's Own in 2013, other schools have picked up on the program's relevance in today's world? ? ?including Emory University, the University of Oklahoma, and Davidson College, as well as at several high schools. Domain of One's Own has also spun out a startup of sorts, Reclaim Hosting, that provides low-cost Web hosting and helps educators offer their students their own domains. Clarence Fisher introduced Domains last year to his high school students at the Joseph H. Kerr School in Snow Lake, Manitoba. ""The kids came in to the class with what I would call fair and average teen tech skills,"" he said. ""Lots of iPods, iPads, and laptops. Lots of Facebook and Instagram. But none of them had a presence online they were in control of beforeæthis."" This observation was echoed by Bryan Jackson, who has implemented Domains at Gleneagle Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia. ""I wanted them to see and be aware of all of the options and the control that they are giving up when services such as Facebook are their primary web presence,"" he said. By contrast, he introduced his students to open source platforms like WordPress, teaching them about Web standards like HTML and CSS. Often when schools talk to students about their presence on the Web, they do so in terms of digital citizenship: what students need to know in order to use technology ""appropriately."" Schools routinely caution students about the things they post on social media, and the tenor of this conversation? ? ?particularly as translated by the media? ? ?is often tinged with fears that students will be seen ""doing bad things"" or ""saying bad things"" that will haunt them forever. While some schools are turning to social media monitoring firms to keep an eye on students online, rarely do schools give students the opportunity to demonstrate the good work that they do publicly. Nor do schools give students the opportunity to decide what and when and how that public, online display should look like. It's a drawback to our digital citizenship conversations? ? ?we're concerned about what students do online but we fail to probe the ""appropriateness"" of the demands on data and content that (education) technology companies increasingly make on the students in turn. It's one of the flaws too with how privacy conversations about education technology are usually framed. Debates about what happens to student data? ? ?who it's shared with, for example? ? ?seldom include students' input. These debates do not recognize the ways in which students have already developed rich social lives online and could use help, not punishment or paternalism, in understanding how to think through the data trails they're leaving behind. There is an understandable learning curve to helping students manage their online presence via their own domain. ""At first there was a fair amount of fumbling around, Googling solutions, and trying to understand their options,"" said teacher Clarence Fisher. ""Within a week, the kids were able to understand what their options were and how their site was affected by changes they made. As time went on, we talked a lot more about technical issues (backup, recovery, privacy options, hosting laws in different countries, etc). But we also talked a lot more about digital citizenship, safety, control, design, etc. The kids saw the site much more as their own and their responsibility."" The importance of giving students responsibility for their own domain cannot be overstated. This can be a way to track growth and demonstrate new learning over the course of a student's school career? ? ?something that they themselves can reflect upon, not simply grades and assignments that are locked away in a proprietary system controlled by theæschool. And if a student owns their own domain, as she moves from grade to grade and from school to school, all that information? ? ?their learning portfolio? ? ?can travel with them. Education technology? ? ?and more broadly, the culture of education? ? ?does a terrible job with this sort of portability and interoperability. When a student moves to a new school, for example, they often have to request their transcript, a document that lists their courses and their grades. A transcript is by definition a copy of their education record. The transcript is often printed on a piece of paper with formal letterhead, perhaps with a watermark or stamp to show that it's ""official."" This lack of portability continues in much digital schoolwork too. Even if students are encouraged to create online portfolios or to use services like Google Apps for Education in order to store all their work, they don't actually get to take that work with them when they move or graduate. (In the case of Google Apps, you can download your files. But then you'll need to find a new place to store them.) Too often, students' work in these systems gets deleted over the summer months as schools aren't in the business of permanently storing student work. School district IT is not the right steward for student work: the student is. Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web, to have their scholarship be meaningful and accessible by others. It allows them to demonstrate their learning to others beyond the classroom walls. To own one's domain gives students an understanding of how Web technologies work. It puts them in a much better position to control their work, their data, their identity online. ""I want to know where my ones and zeros are stored,"" said Bryan Jackson, referring to the basic binary code in which computers ïthink.' ""And I want my students to know that that's something they can ask about, and learn to manage for themselves."" "Jim Groom,Domains and the Cost of Innovation,http://bavatuesdays.com/domains-and-the-cost-of-innovation/,7/18/2015,"> Domain names ? part of the answer to the digital skills gap? https://t.co/VVeGQQ6MiR ? inspired by @audreywatters  >  >  ?  Jim Knight (@jimpknight) July 17, 2015  Audrey Watters brilliant article ""The Web We Need to Give Students"" delineates a host of excellent reasons for why students should be provided a space of their own on the web as part of their formal education. She argues this is just important for K12 as it is for higher education, featuring Clarence Fisher and Bryan Jackson (those damn innovative Canadians!) to underscore the work already being done in this regard. A domain and web hosting provides a platform that's on and of the web, as Watters notes, providing a portal to an entire world of intellectual opportunities:  > Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web, to have their scholarship be meaningful and accessible by others. It allows them to demonstrate their learning to others beyond the classroom walls. To own one's domain gives students an understanding of how Web technologies work. It puts them in a much better position to control their work, their data, their identity online.  Given Audrey's remarkable pen and tremendous reach, I wasn't entirely surprised to learn former schools minister in the UK, Jim Knight, picked up on the idea of a Domain of One's Own as a compelling approach to teaching digital skills. What's more, the post in which he frames his thinking has the following as its sub-header ""Jim Knight considers stealing an innovative idea from the US."" I'm sure more than a few of the UK folks in my network are cringing at this idea given they have been a part of this conversation for years. Nonetheless, this is a major coup for UMW and it's domain program, right?  Absolutely! University of Mary Washington deserves a lot of credit when it comes to getting behind a domains project, funding it, and trying to build it into the fabric of the university. Ironically, however, at the same time UMW's role as an international force for innovation in edtech is being widely recognized, the group that made it happen is disbanding. There are a lot of reasons for this, and I can't speak for anyone else. But for me, it became increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to run a group filled with some of the best talent in the field and still offer less than $50,000 ?  sadly the starting salary I got back in 2005. UMW got lucky for a long time in this regard, we all worked for far less than we were worth (I think that's a <del>institution-wide</del> nationwide reality), but we had freedom, with little to no oversight for most of that time.  But with a project like Domain of One's Own that's changed over the past year. It's a high profile project and a lot of folks have taken an interest, in a Barton Fink sorta way.  And that could be a very good thing, but as we have been suggesting for years, our success was premised on an investment in people. It was our group's collective belief that if we continued to do great things year-after-year and prove our value (which I think we have) the resources would follow. As it turns out they didn't, and I think that was the hardest part of my role (and my biggest failure) as director over the last couple of years ? realizing that no matter what we did and how successful we were, the resources necessary to sustain our group ? no less build on our successes ? would never materialize. I really wanted to believe. It's been a hard pill to swallow.  All this said, I know this is a broader reality playing out across higher education right now. The late logic of capital has come home to roost in academia: do more with less, lucky to have a job, tenuous tenure, the mission, austerity, budget cuts, everyone's expendable, etc. But the fact is I firmly believe none of us at UMW are expendable. It really was, is, and will continue to be about the people. So if anyone out there is considering a Domain of One's Own project, know this, the tech can be very, very cheap. It's the right people that will be expensive, and for good reason ? they determine its success. And success means integrating a digital-based curriculum across a university culture ? this takes support, resources, and a concerted effort of talent. If you're thinking about doing something like this I highly recommend you invest in some excellent people, pay them what they deserve, and trust them to do great things. Major kudos to VCU's ALT Lab in this regard, they have been creating positions at really competitive salaries. Not sure how Gardner Campbell is doing it, but it lifts us all up.  In fact, this is what I have seen at various schools who have taken up this project. The University of Oklahoma has invested heavily in Adam Croom, Mark Morvant and many others to carry out various digital projects, including the important work of OU Create. Channel Islands has invested in folks like Michael McGarry, Michelle Pacansky-Brock, Jill Leafstedt, and Jamie Hoffman to integrate CI Keys into their culture. Davidson has done the same with Mark Sample and Kristen Eshleman for their Domains project. All these projects revolve around a cadre of folks who are doing great things, and pushing experimentation and freedom forward.  But let me be clear, I am more than proud of the work we have done with UMW Domains on the back of Tim Owens ?? It's been part of a longer tradition, and I think Mary Washington should certainly be excited about being touted internationally as the home of an innovative project the UK should import. At the same time, there must also be the recognition that the very conditions that made this possible have been eroding steadily over the last several years. Continued wage stagnation (we got two or three raises in the ten years I was at UMW) and an attempt to institutionalize that innovation without the requisite resources. But the good news is that none of this is a foregone conclusion, UMW still has the ability to consider investing in this group, and actually bringing in the caliber of people needed to continue what's become a pretty special tradition ? one I'd be heartbroken to see ""disrupted."" Anyone who has worked at an institution knows that the powers that be have the ability to invest in those things that are important to them, I still want to believe, regardless of all evidence, that UMW's DTLT is one of those things.  "Jim Groom,Two Years of Reclaim Hosting,http://bavatuesdays.com/two-years-of-reclaim-hosting/,7/31/2015,"> Is it a coincidence @ReclaimHostingïs birthday coincides with #SysAdminDay? #ithinknot We love @timmmmyboy!!!  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) July 31, 2015  Two years ago my partner Tim Owens and I rushed down to the Fredericksburg county clerk and gave birth to the two-headed monstrosity that is Reclaim Hosting. I didn't realize at the time how momentous that would prove 24 short months later. Tim has been full-time for over six months. We hired our first employee, Lauren Brumfield, last month. And I'm going full-time myself, which will allow my family and I to setup shop in Italy for at least a year. All of this made possible by the awesome folks around higher ed and beyond that continue to support the work we are doing. I couldn't be more excited about where we are right now.  All Hail the great Michael Branson Smith!  Last year at this time we had two institutions locked into a Domain of One's Own project, and two others considering it. This year? We setup up four institutions just this week! And we will have at least 20 schools running a Domain of One's Own initiative come fall. I've been in a bit of a zone the last month or so trying to wrap my head around the Reclaim Hosting infrastructure. I went through the entire process of getting an institution up and running on their own server with only minimal help. Tim has not only carried the load, but he has also architected a pretty amazing experience for schools. Feels good to finally be able to help him out some so he can get back to R&D.  > .@zdavis once said, ""Behind every EDUPUNK is a frazzled sysadmin."" Think of @reclaimhosting as the frazzled sysadmin of awesome #edtech  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) July 31, 2015  One of the things we're offering that has me really excited is sane and accessible server/sysadmin support ? something that proved invaluable for me when starting at UMW. While I was still getting my head around domains, web hosting, WordPress, etc., I leaned heavily on my friend Zach Davis. I went to that font of knowledge countless times while setting up UMW Blogs. Zach understands servers, web hosting, programming, open source applications, and more. He got me into all this, and he was always very liberal and gracious with his time getting me out of trouble. But, astonishingly enough, ostensibly few ed-tech and digital humanities outfits in higher ed have this kind of support. And none of them have Tim Owens! Reclaim Hosting is all about providing infrastructure and support for those schools that can't get it locally. And we are doing it at insanely affordable rates. That's something we pride ourselves on ? we want our work to be as accessible to as many people as possible.  Thanks D'Arcy Norman!  The other thing I am excited about is re-thinking hosting in terms of a personalized dashboard for managing one's digital life bits across time and space. We want to try and re-architect hosting to be both abstracted and deeply personal at once. We're continuing to chase the vision that has fueled UMW Blogs, ds106, and Domain of One's Own for years ? but we might actually have the people and resources to truly start to build the digital future we want to live in! Happy birthday, Reclaim Hosting. I am a very big <del>Finn</del> fan!  "Jim Groom,Digital Pedagogy as Empowered Choice,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-pedagogy-as-empowered-choice/,8/13/2015,"I had the pleasure of remotely participating in a conversation with Jared Stein and Bonnie Stewart at the Digital Pedagogy Lab this morning. The topic of our discussion centered around balancing the benefits of open and closed approaches to digital pedagogy. An exchange that often comes down to the LMS vs open tools like Twitter, blogs, wikis, etc. What was interesting for me about this conversation was that strict dichotomy is starting to break down in my mind. The question of open vs closed (one I have been harping on for years) is beginning to morph into one centered around ownership, agency, and control.  Pitting open against closed assumes one right approach: open=good and closed=bad. At UMW we've defaulted our various systems to open (save the LMS) as a way of pushing our community's work out on the web. In this regard, UMW Blogs and UMW Domains have become synonymous with open, whereas the LMS has often been understood as the closed space for digital course work. And while this approach to open at UMW has come to define our ethos, one I very much believe in, it also became our prison. Such a stance makes it hard to draw the nuances that were necessary to recognize a spectrum between these two poles.  But increasingly the question seems to be moving towards whether or not faculty and students can control their data. I shift I think Audrey Watters and Kin Lane, amongst others, have done a ton of work to raise awareness around. More and more I find myself thinking about a distributed, API-driven architecture that enables folks to share the work on their own terms, while at the same time making the act of sharing seamless across all these systems, whether it be the LMS, one's own domain, blogs, the university web site, etc. What intrigues me about this shift is that it returns the decision of sharing back to the individual, rather than a pre-determined choice between LMS versus blog baked into the design of the system. How to we foreground choice and empower folks to make an informed decision?  Such an architecture might help re-focus the question of digital pedagogy back to conversations amongst faculty and students ? enabling agency beyond the either/or questions of which system. Andrew Rikardïs recent article in EdSurge, ""Do I Own My Domain If You Grade It?"", argues that while the push for owning your own data and the greater potential for agency is important, the real shift should focus on a move from ""data possession to knowledge production"":  > I agree that owning data has the potential to give students agency and control. But it is not a guarantee.  >  > I want to shift the emphasis from data possession to knowledge production. Gaining ownership over the data is vital ? but until students see this domain as a space that rewards rigor and experimentation, it will not promote student agency. Traditional assignments don't necessarily empower students when they have to post them in a public space.  I couldn't agree with Rikard more here. The shift towards the vision of a personal cyberinfrastructure must be accompanied by a shift in pedagogy that is centered around this idea of creative experimentation. I think this might also open up all sorts of questions surrounding the the role of the domain as an individual versus communal space; the benefits of the traditional stream- driven web versus an alternative, federated vision preached by Mike Caulfield with Smallest Federated Wiki; whether the true revolution at the center of digital pedagogy is to surrender any sense of unilateral power in the classroom, etc.  What I like about this line of discussion is that it frames the questions of digital pedagogy around issues of agency that pertain to both ownership of data as well as ownership of one's education. Digital pedagogy as a pathway to empowered choice. Both of these shifts require a relinquishing of centralized control, deep faith in collaboration, mutual respect, and a vision of education as empowerment. All things I dig, and a conversation that starts to move us away from discussions around open vs closed that seem increasingly overdetermined.

Jim Groom (@jimgroom) August 14, 2015  I've been pushing small, easy tools (what folks refer to as SPLOTs) like Timeline JS a lot these days because they use popular services like Google spreadsheets, are dead simple, and are collaborative. With Timeline JS an entire class could work together to create an dynamic, attractive timeline. That said, Timeline JS isn't all that new either, it's been around a couple of years as well. Nonetheless, I really like the possibilities of using small, focused and really simple tools for getting faculty and students excited about digital projects. I then soon followed up with my own fascination these days, namely higher ed finally digging into how virtual infrastructure, APIs, and even containerized applications might impact the field in the near future:  > @sleslie Also think rise of alternative architecture/infrastructure like AWS, Docker, APIs, etc. might not yet be present, but on verge of.  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) August 14, 2015  You see, I remain a believer. I think we're always on the verge of realizing the next stage of augmenting human intellect. What else is there? Also, I refuse to let the perceived setbacks of the last few years throw me off the path to enlightenment. For all the turmoil, co-option, and hyperbolic virtual- ink spilt on MOOCs, I remain amazed by the fact that Siemens, Downes and Cormier were able to make such a colossal impact on higher ed as representatives of this rag-tag field of edtech. It remains a source of inspiration for me. But that by no means erases the constant struggle against the mindless MOOC-hype, nefarious narratives of labor efficiency, reification of Silicon Valley, corporatization of edtech, etc. Given how powerful some of the ideas born out of this ed-tech network have been, I can't see the value of despair.  > @jimgroom yeah, I'll give you SPLOT (but c'mon, haven't we been chasing that for a decade?)

Scott Leslie (@sleslie) August 14, 2015  Higher Ed has been playing catch-up for the last ten years when it comes to social media, and I have no problem serving as an ambassador to new applications for infrastructure, integrations, etc. It's the job, in my mind. If we were on the edge, they wouldn't need me. Also, I'm not so sure most other industries are all that better off in the end, and a bit of distance may have some value.  > @sleslie Not sure chasing latest innovation year after year is the goal. Still some awesome shot being done in something as archaic as wpƒ  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) August 14, 2015  The other issue that came up over a slice of pizza with Tim Owens, was that chasing the latest innovation could be its own trap. Frankly, Domain of One's Own is trailing edge technology, and you could argue some of the most interesting stuff being done is dependent on that washed-up application WordPress ??  But my responses reflect my own blinders in the field of edtech. Thinking more about my answers, the truly important shifts have been around assumptions surrounding gender, race, and class. Arguably the most important voice in edtech the last few years, Audrey Watters, has been on a tireless intellectual campaign to challenge many of the most nefarious narratives as well as interrogate both the future past of the field. I would argue the true shift in edtech we've been experiencing has less to do with any particularly innovative technology, and everything to do with the recognition, interrogation, and challenging of pre-defined identities and nodes of power. This has been both both a difficult and hopeful shift because we might begin to apply this critical discourse around identities across a range of disciplines to a rich field of cutting-edge praxis. So thinking more about Scott's original call, I think the most important development in the field has also been the most difficult: coming to terms with some of the deep assumptions of privilege and power, and figuring out how we integrate that conversation into the field of edtech purposefully.

The registrar goes through alternating strategies from wooing to scaring to trying to make it work to resignation to withholding during a simple process of transferring a domain from one company to another. What's more, they're up-selling you all the while. It's very sinister design. Did I mention they're charging 2 to 3 times the going rate of a domain? Insane.  Here's a quick screenshot play-by-play of trying to get the authorization code to transfer a domain. A process that should be transparent and made possible in a clock or two. Speaking of which, I had to click twice before getting to the first screenshot I feature below.  First comes the wooing, ""STOP!"", we know we've been gouging you, can we offer you a $10 domain? Also, don't mind the asterisk ? there are all kinds of strings attached, but you don't need to know about them.  I call this the wooing, but it could also be seen as a cheap bribe.

I get the opportunity to announce that what was once a small pilot called OU Create, heavily modeled after the Domain of One's Own project at the University of Mary Washington, is moving into full production. For the past year, our ability to serve everyone on campus was somewhat limited. While domains are still a relatively affordable solution, in order to serve a campus our size we are moving a ""Subdomain of One's Own"" model. For free, all OU faculty, staff, and students can get a subdomain of oucreate.com or can individually purchase a domain for $12/yr, which is still the option I will be recommending to my students due to the full ownership and easy transferability.Just getting ready for the semester it's been exciting to see the buzz on OU Create. Nathan Gerth at the Carl Albert Center has been an absolute machine. He's had access to OU Create for all of two months and has created six sites including a course site, a virtual exhibit on model rockets , and a subject guides site to give visitors insight into the thematic overview of the Carl Albert Center Congressional Archives. Several lab groups, like this one led by Thomas Neeson, which studies the impacts of global change on freshwater ecosystems, have launched virtual spaces. Another faculty member, Bob Pavlik, has also been blogging at one of my favorite OU Create domain names: thearchitecturegarage.com. Last, I'm not exactly sure the details on this one, but a student is using OU Create to create a secret dinner society.

Adam Croom (@acroom) August 21, 2015  Earlier today Adam Croom shared that OU Create (the University of Oklahoma's Domain initiative) would be open and freely available to the entire campus. That's pretty remarkable news, and quite a testament to the unbelievable work folks like Adam, Mark Morvant, and Kyle Harper have done over the last year. It's deeply rewarding on a personal level (and I imagine Tim might feel similarly) because Oklahoma's interest, excitement, and faith in Reclaim helped us take the leap from giving free hosting and $12 domains to providing a full blown domain and web hosting infrastructure for an entire campus.  History for me is always personal, and I track the history of Reclaim through the people who helped make it happen. It goes without saying the work Tim Owens was doing in the Winter and Spring of 2012 with Hippie Hosting is foundational, and the inspiration for that shoeless co-operative started because folks like Alan Levine, D'Arcy Norman, Dave Cormier, and Scott Leslie were clamoring for options beyond Dreamhost and their ilk (amirite?). That's the work that would come to define the Domain of One's Own pilot at UMW during the 2012/2013 academic year.  Hippie Hosting  The birth of Reclaim Hosting as an idea to help universities run their own Domains projects will be forever connection with David Morgen and our trip to Emory University in January 2013. Tim and I hatched the idea on the VRE ride back to Fredericksburg after that trip while dreaming about the possibilities.  How Canadians are hatched  Reclaim's embryonic stage is deeply associated, at least for me, with my first real crossing of paths with Audrey Watters and Kin Lane at the MIT Hackathon in March 2013 ? nicknamed Reclaim Open. We named the baby soon after ?? It was born July 31, 2013 thanks to $800 leftover from a Shuttleworth grant made possible by David Wiley, and a crazy push from Tim to say we could actually do this. We had a tremendous amount of interest when we first announced the idea, and we realized we might need some serious money for domains, so we did a community callout for a short-term loan, and raised almost $12K from our community within a week. A vast majority of it made possible by Mike Caulfieldïs unparalleled generosity. Turns out we overestimated how much we would really need (who knew 1500 people wouldn't sign up in one day?) so we were able return the money within the month. But how amazing that folks supported our efforts from the get-go and helped us finance the beginnings of this adventure with no expectations of anything in return.  The following year was a roller coaster. We had over 1500 sign-ups from August through June, and we only charged folks $12, essentially the cost of a domain ? we threw in a year's hosting for free. At the same time I started digging in around the idea of the next generation of campus tilde spaces, and started presenting about Geocities, the long history of domains, and the fact that higher ed built the web, yet we continue to denature ourselves from its true potential for teaching and learning. Blah blah blah. [Much of this work was inspired by my co-teaching the Internet Course with Paul Bond, and my part at least fueled my portion of the Reclaiming Innovation article I co-wrote with Brian Lamb.]  It was the presentation at Sloan-C, ""Domains in the Afterglow,"" in April 2014 where all these elements finally came together in a semi-cohesive vision. That was also where and when institutions like Oklahoma and Cal State Channel Islands started to show some interest in the work Tim and I were doing. Interestingly enough, at that same moment Reclaim Hosting was down to it's last couple of hundred dollars, and Tim and I were kind of ignoring the fact that we weren't really sure what was next. We provided a compelling model for faculty and students getting cheap one-off sites for courses, as well as highlighting the real power of having a hosting company for the education sector run by folks who have a deep understanding of ed-tech. That said, we were doing everything at cost. And at least for a little while during late Spring I started thinking, ""Well, that was fun, and it makes sense as an idea. But, alas, our bank account is near empty, so I hope someone with some business sense runs with it. What's next?""  But then Tim and I got a call from Adam and Mark at Oklahoma (if you give any story enough time it gets back to its original point) who basically said they had gotten all the approvals and made everything possible logistically, they just needed to know if we could run a 1000 person pilot that coming Fall with Reclaim. I was sitting at the dining room table in my brother's house in Montauk, L.I., it was late June and our vacation had just started. Listening to Mark and Adam commit marked yet another moment in Reclaim Hosting's story. We had found partners at the institutional level who wanted to work with us. They knew we were a two person, rag-tag outfit with big mouths (that would be me) and big archiTECHtural chops (Timmmmmyboy!) and they had faith in us. Tim and I were pinching ourselves.  That moment helped us re-calibrate for the coming year. And like dominoes, other schools started calling as well. Just a few days later Cal State Channel Islands committed to a pilot thanks to Chris Mattia, Michael Berman, Michelle Pacansky-Brock and Jill Leafstedt. All of whom, including the folks at Oklahoma, were at the Sloan-C workshop and presentation about Domains in the Afterglow.  Channel Islands pushed Tim and I on the idea of doing what we called a ""Subdomain of One's Own,"" which effectively provided all the affordances of web hosting as a subdomain of a top-level domain such as cikeys.com. So I could have jimgroom.cikeys.com and students and faculty could choose to purchase their own domain at the time of sign-up ? a step which made Domain of One's Own far more affordable for schools to run. This is exactly what Oklahoma is doing in their current roll-out campus-wide.  A few days after Channel Islands, Kristin Eshleman and Mark Sample of Davison College called to commit to a pilot. Insane. And to tie it all up in a neat package, David Morgen from Emory (the point of inception [INCEPTION!]) brought the Domains project they had already been running for an entire year over to Reclaim Hosting. What we might call the first Fantastic Four institutions of Reclaim Hosting.  The academic year of 2014/2015 is a blur. I don't really remember given all that happened, but I do know we had four amazing institutional partners, over 2500 faculty and students on our shared hosting, and Reclaim was no longer a side project. It was bonafide. This fall we have 20 more institutions joining Reclaim Hosting, and our shared hosting service has been growing exponentially, and we are quickly approaching the 5000 mark. It's been a really, really intense 14 months since that call with Adam and Mark in late June, but all the dreams and visions that flashed before my eyes on that call are coming true. And we really couldn't have had better partners along the way. From faculty like John Maxwell at Simon Fraser University who early on believed in what we were doing (I love that guy!) to UMW graduates like Amber May who will soon be our newest reclaimer!  When I read Adam Croom's post <del>today</del> yesterday (I spent a lot of time writing this) I simply meant to draw attention to it and note how they had realized the half-baked vision of the next generation tilde spaces for higher ed at an institutional level I would have thought impossible last June. Here's the bit from the email Adam sent to the entire Oklahoma community that struck me:  > Today I'm excited to let you know that, with the support of the Office of the Senior Vice President and Provost and OU Information Technology, OU Create is moving to full production and requests for use will no longer be required. Starting today, users can register a subdomain (yourname.oucreate.com) at no cost or purchase a top-level domain (yourdomain.com) for $12/year. This domain is registered directly to the user, owned by them, and transferable to any domain registrar at any point in time.  >  > Because OU Create is now openly available to members of the OU community, OU IT will begin a process of decommissioning older web services. Students.ou.edu will be taken offline following the Fall 2015 semester and faculty- staff.ou.edu will be set to expire at the end of Summer 2016. All files maintained within these spaces that you wish to keep will need to be transferred to OU Create.  This email feels like another giant leap in Reclaim's short history, and we could have only gotten to this point because we work with some seriously awesome folks who want to empower their community members to share far and wide.  "Adeline Koh,Starting Your Own Website: Reclaim Your Hosting,http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/starting-your-own-website-reclaim-your-hosting/60939,9/7/2015,"If you're a regular ProfHacker reader, you probably understand the importance of building and having control over your web presence. We've posted a ""Website Hosting 101 guide back in 2009, a primer for creating your digital presence in 2011  with a guest post by Miriam Posner, and tips on how, and how often to update your website by Anastasia.  Now that the new school year has begun, some of you may be looking to start a professional website of your own. To create a website, you're going to need two important things:    1. a domain name: a web address where your site can be found, and   2. web hosting: space on a remote webserver that will display your content when a user accesses your web address.  You've probably heard names such as BlueHost, GoDaddy, and HostGator as services people use for domain names and web hosting, all of which are commercially run and will generally cost you at least $100/year for everything that you need.  A few months ago, I gave up the commercial hosting service I used for my professional website in favor of a small company known as Reclaim Hosting. Reclaim Hosting comes out of the groundbreaking Domain of One's Own project from the University of Mary Washington, which gives all UMW faculty, staff, and students their own domains and associates them with a college webserver. Reclaim Hosting, run by Jim Groom, Tim Owens, and Lauren Brumfield, is giving the commercial hosting services a serious run for their money with plans that start from $25/year for individuals and $45/year for users needing multiple domains?seriously, the best prices I have found on the the Internet.  I've been absolutely thrilled with the service and have been recommending it to everyone that I know. Reclaim Hosting took care of the transfer of my existing websites such that the transition took place without any hiccups. Their chat service for troubleshooting is really fast and responsive?I usually hear back from them in an hour during working hours. Even better, Reclaim Hosting is all set up to quickly launch digital humanities projects and tools?common DH content management systems like WordPress, Scalar, Omeka, Drupal and Vanilla Forums that many DH projects use can be simply installed with a few clicks after signing up and getting your own domain name.  It's been four months since I've switched to Reclaim Hosting and I cannot say better things about the service and the people running it. It's the service I recommend during my monthly webinars where I train academics to set up their own website, because they offer by far the best prices and terrific customer service. If you are thinking about signing up with them or switching, RH has kindly given me a 20% off for the first year coupon to share with ProfHacker readers. If you're interested in the $25/year plan, use ""reclaim4edu"" (no quotes); and use ""fac4life"" (no quotes) for the $45/year plan. Switching from a commercial host to RH has saved me more than a hundred dollars a year, and I get better, more responsive service that is tailored to academic use to boot. I hope you get to try them out!  What do you use for your web hosting needs? Please share in the comments.

I was helping Gwen Hale's Writing for Nursing students get up and running with their own domain and web hosting. I started with a 15 minute presentation about what UMW Domains is and why it matters. Then we had a 30 minute workshop to get them to create their domain, provide an overview of CPanel, and have them WordPress in a subdomain. It's remarkable to think about the fact that 9 years ago it took me the same amount of time to get students to join a group blog.  I really love the class visits, and I have had a blast over the years. I visited many a class in my 10 years at UMW, and I never really got tired of them. Part of that is because, admittedly, I am a ham. But the other thing that has kept them fresh for me is that I rarely do the same thing twice. It's a kind of personal tech jazz mediated by what I am reading, watching, thinking about, etc. That helps keep it fun, at least for me. What's more, I always imagined at least part of my role at UMW was to make an impression upon the people I work with when it comes to technology. I don't want them to think about this as just another thing to do, I want them to think about Domains or UMW Blogs or ds106 as THE thing to do. I want them to feel a sense of immediacy and importance, and that often takes equal parts enthusiasm, entertainment and storytelling.  So, during this last class visit I went on a bit of a rant about corporate silo sites, data as the new oil, and the veneer of privacy. It was pretty awesome. What fueled it was the following bit from The Power of Habit I came across on Twitter via Tumblr recently.  The highlighted text underlines the fact that companies like Target (and I imagine Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.) are mindful that they now have way too much data about us. So much so that they need to make it look like they aren't spying on us. They need to start tricking us to think they don't know as much as they do so we aren't fooled. It's like the Matrix. And it is spooky!  Domains are the red (or is it blue) pill. It's a way if pulling back the curtain to start to understand how this stuff works. That was the conceit, that was the thing that drove the 15 minute information session about Domain of One's Own. I believe a tight, focused argument around this one idea goes much further than a pitch for a portfolio solution ? despite the utility of the latter.  "Jim Groom,Re-ordering Pizza in 2015,http://bavatuesdays.com/re-ordering-pizza-in-2015/,9/12/2015,"Back in early June of this year I had the good fortune of listening to Phil Windley talking about digital identity, sovereign source identity, block chain, and much more at BYU's The University API event. I deeply respect the caliber of thinking around these questions the BYU IT team bring to their approach to APIs and Domain of One's Own, and I am getting ready to head out to Provo at the end of the month to talk about just this. One of the things Phil showed off during one of the sessions that stuck with me was the 2004 video created by the American Civil Liberties Union titled ""Ordering a Pizza in 2015.""  The video provides a view of what the unregulated collection of our personal data by corporations could mean in 2015. It's an brilliantly executed quotidian dystopia story. It all starts off very normal: man orders pizza. But quickly spirals into ab absurd, Kafkaesque world of surveillance and control. A satirical play that highlights how quickly the unchecked harvesting of our personal data erodes some basic tenets of a free society. I love the way this video walks the fine line between the everyday and the fantastic. And what's even crazier 11 years later through this piece is that the chilling future possible of 2004 has become status quo in 2015.  So, yesterday I borrowed this page from Phil Windley's book during a presentation Martha Burtis and I did at the Universidad del Sagrado CorazÑn about Domain of One's Own and digital identity (more on that in a forthcoming post). The video was well received, and it is a testament to the fact that the worst kind of clean, well-lighted dystopias can come true. The clip provided a simultaneously comic and horrific view of our current moment.  After this video I went on to discuss the above clip featuring Edward Snowden, a bit frightening how well the two worked together. The protection of our personal data online is first and foremost a civil liberties issue!  "Mark Sample,What are the bottlenecks of Davidson Domains?,http://www.samplereality.com/2015/09/13/what-are-the-bottlenecks-of-davidson-domains/,9/13/2015,"Schnitzer, Jannis Andrija. Siggi's Bottleneck. Photograph, April 10, 2010. Flickr. https://www.flickr.com/photos/xjs-khaos/4530132195/.  A bottleneck is a great conceptual metaphor to describe those pedagogical moments where a significant number of learners get stuck. Identifying bottlenecks is the first step toward designing learning pathways through those bottlenecks. I'm borrowing the idea from the Decoding the Disciplines project at Indiana University. As Joan Middendorf, one of the project leaders, puts it, ""Bottlenecks are important because they signal where students are unable to grasp crucial ways of knowing in our fields."" The question of bottlenecks is a central concern in the opening weeks of the Davidson Domains Digital Learning Community.  Let me backtrack. What is Davidson Domains? What is the Davidson Domains Learning Community?  ## Davidson Domains  Davidson Domains is a pilot program that gives faculty, staff, and students a ""domain of one's own"" ? an online space for blogs, exhibits, research, creative work, portfolios, web development, programming, and more. Users name their domain and maintain control over it. Faculty and students can create a domain for their courses, but they can also use it outside of coursework. The Davidson Domains pilot is a partnership between the Digital Studies program, Davidson's Center for Teaching and Learning, and our instructional technology team. The pilot is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  The mission of Davidson Domains is to enable faculty and students to:     Develop technical and critical web literacies;    Forge a digital identity through online publishing;    Reclaim ownership and control over one's digital footprint;    Explore the possibilities of blended learning and social pedagogies.  Underlying this mission is a fundamental concern of the liberal arts: to raise technical, philosophical, artistic, economic, and political questions about the role of the Internet on ourselves, our communities, and our practices.  We quietly launched Davidson Domains a year ago and have seen dramatic growth. To wit:  The number of accounts on Davidson Domains in September 2014: 0  The number of accounts on Davidson Domains in May 2015: 255  The number of accounts on Davidson Domains in September 2015: 500  And we're about to add capacity for 500 more accounts, making Davidson Domains available to nearly half the campus community. We haven't tied the roll-out of Davidson Domains to any particular year of students (say, all rising seniors) or program (for example, the First Year Writing Program). Rather, faculty and students are developing their Domains Across the Curriculum (DAC) based on interest and need. Given that we've registered 500 accounts in 9 months, that's a lot of interest and need.  ## Davidson Domains Learning Community  We kicked off Davidson Domains in December 2014 with a two-day workshop led by Jim Groom and Tim Owens. Jim and Tim are pioneers of the ""domain of one's own"" movement and co-founders of Reclaim Hosting, our partner providing the actual domains. My collaborators at Davidson, including Kristen Eshleman, Anelise Shrout, and Katie Wilkes, have worked tirelessly with faculty and students on Davidson Domains as well. But this formal and informal faculty development isn't enough. We don't simply want a bunch of people using Davidson Domains, we want to build a community of practice around Davidson Domains.  This desire for ? as Etienne Wenger describes a community of practice ? a group ""of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly"" is the impetus behind the newly formed Davidson Domains Learning Community. Approximately 25 faculty, staff, and students will meet as a group throughout the semester to think through the rewards, challenges, and possibilities of Davidson Domains. Smaller affinity groups of 3-4 people will also meet on their own to explore more focused topics, for instance, using domains to foster student dialogue or to support longitudinal constructive student projects.  We've learned over the past year that faculty have recurring questions about Davidson Domains, which include:     How do domains fit in with other technologies (like Moodle)?    Where do we find good models?    What's the balance between student agency and scaffolding?    What about privacy and copyright?    Can we preserve the work on domains?  We hope to answer these questions for our faculty and students, or at least begin conversations about them. But I also have my own questions about Davidson Domains, more conceptual in nature:     How does total and free access to online domains change teaching, learning, and research in a liberal arts environment?    What happens when a community asks the same questions together, and repeatedly, over the course of the semester?  These questions are not simply idle musings. They are research questions. The first tackles the underlying premise of the entire domain of one's own movement, while the second tackles the notion of a learning community. Working with Kristen Eshleman, Davidson's Director of Digital Learning Research & Design, I aim to systematically explore these questions, with the Davidson Domains Learning Community serving as our object of study.  ## The Bottlenecks of Davidson Domains  Which brings me back to the question of bottlenecks. The affinity groups have a topic to discuss during their first meeting, the notes of which they'll share with the rest of the learning community. That topic is the question of bottlenecks ? the essential skills, concepts, and ways of thinking that stump us:  What are the bottlenecks for you or your students for working with Davidson Domains?  As David Pace and Joan Middendorf point out, there is a typology of bottlenecks. Understanding what type of bottlenecks we and our students face makes it easier to design ways of overcoming them. Bottlenecks might be:     technical (getting the technology itself to work)    procedural (knowing how to enact conceptual knowledge)    affective (affective perspectives or emotional responses that hinder us)    disciplinary (discipline-specific knowledge and practices)  For example, one faculty member told me she struggles with what she calls ""Internet shyness"" ? this is a kind of affective bottleneck. Another faculty member noted that the text- and image-heavy nature of blogs worked against her teaching priorities, which in the performing arts depend upon embodied knowledge. That's a disciplinary bottleneck. Our students, I'm sure, will face these and many other bottlenecks. But until we articulate them, we're unable to move forward to address them. (I guess this is the bottleneck of bottlenecks.)  We are just getting started with the learning community, and I can't wait to see where we end up. I believe that Davidson Domains are essential for the liberal arts in the digital age, and this community of practice will help us explain why. I'll record our progress here from a more conceptual perspective, while the nitty-gritty progress will show up on our learning community site. In the meantime I'll leave you with the slides from our first plenary meeting.  Source: What are the bottlenecks of Davidson Domains?

What's State University? It's Tim Owensïs latest project to showcase just how elegant and painless he's made the whole process. What's more, the site demonstrates the experience we have created for the 22 schools running the Domain of One's Own institutional package. We set the site up as a trial space that provides inquiring minds a 30-day trial to experience the service.  We did something similar last year when we rolled out http://reclaim.host, but that didn't highlight the institutional experience, nor did it provide a simple, elegant login system for folks who want to try it out. That has all changed now. One of the coolest elements of this new space is the fact that anyone with a Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn can automatically authenticate through those services and get up and running with their trial account immediately. It literally takes seconds to setup and account, install an application, and start creating. This accurately represents the environment we have created for schools by hooking into a wide range of single sign-on environments.  I inaugurated this site for a faculty workshop at the Universidad del Sagrado CorazÑn designed to introduce them to the power of managing their own web hosting space. We had a great turnout, and everyone in the room had either a Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn profile, so getting them up and running literally took seconds. I've never had such a smooth on-boarding experience during a workshop. But once we started installing applications things slowed down a bit because we were running State U on Linode server with 1 GB of RAM (fine for a few folks, not so much for a room full). So while Martha Burtis worked her magic explaining the form and function of WordPress, I called back to the Reclaim mothership (Tim) and he scaled the server by 8x in less than 10 minutes. Virtualization is a powerful thing. By the time Martha was done, the server was lightening fast and we finished up the workshop which entailed getting them all up and running with a WordPress instance within a subdomain of their account.  > Want to see what it would be like to have Domain of One's own package at your school? Explore http://t.co/FTn1Ie7LBJ It will BLOW YOUR MIND!  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) September 10, 2015  I had also put the call out on Twitter leading up to the workshop, and a few folks tried it out. I was particularly pleased to learn that John Johsnton had given it a spin and was thoroughly impressed.  What I really love about State U is how well it showcases the fact that managing your own webhosting space does not have to be painful. By making it increasingly easier and more user-friendly we're empowering students and faculty everywhere to start reclaiming their piece of the web.That's why we did this whole thing in the first place. State U reinforces the fact that our mission is firmly in tact, and it's quickly becoming more and more difficult to refute the fact that becoming the sysadmin of your digital infrastructure is within the realm of possibility for everyone ? and it need not be expensive either. That's the reclaim mission we envisioned two and a half years ago with Kin Lane and Audrey Watters ? and it's alive and well. Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself. Go to http://stateu.org and explore the control panel or try installing your own WordPress. You're mind will be blown.

Heather,Launching Tiger Domains Pilot Project,http://hjhether.com/blog/2015/09/24/launching-tiger-domains-pilot-project/,9/24/2015,"The big day is here! I've sent invitations to students enrolled in COMM 135 this fall semester to create a ""domain of your own."" Students will use a web hosting service to create a web page for an organization of their choice.  I expect there will be a learning curve for both students and I as we navigate this new technological opportunity together. However, I believe this is how it works: we've got to be comfortable with being uncomfortable as we try out new technology. I believe this will be a great learning experience and one that helps further develop students skills in both technology and effective communication.  "Jim Groom,Initial Notes on an API-Driven Community Site for BYU,http://bavatuesdays.com/initial-notes-on-an-api-driven-community-site-for-byu/,10/9/2015,"Last week Tim and I travelled to Brigham Young University to continue conversations started in June around how BYU's University API initiative, Domain of One's Own, and an emerging vision of personal APIs might converge. We spent the first part of this most excellent trip over dinner. I mention this because it just so happens David Wiley was in town, and Phil Windley was kind enough to invite him out to dinner with all of us. It was a surreal evening because we spent it talking about the parallel work Reclaim Hosting and Lumen Learning are doing, as well as hearing some fascinating stories from Phil about founding iMall, an early creator of e-commerce tools during the mid 1990s. It was one of those dinner conversations that will stick with me for a while, and it energized me thoroughly.  But the following morning it was time to get down to business. We spent most of it getting more insight into how BYU is defining their University API project. What is the University API? Phil Windley lays it out much better than I ever could in this post. But in short, it is the intentional defining, mapping and abstraction of the various relationships of data resources across an entire institution to enable the BYU community to easily access, share, and re-use information on campus and beyond. It draws to mind the Herculean task of building a subway system in an existing, living city like NYC at the turn of the last century. It's arduous, painstaking work ? but essential to modernize infrastructure. We spent a good part of the morning looking at how they defined a variety of resources, but in the end Tim and I are neither linguists, programmers, or information architects so remaining at the level of JSON bracketed abstraction for too long is always dangerous to productivity.  Luckily, we came with a specific plan, and BYU's Chief Information Officer Kelly Flanagan is one of those rare gems that can take that abstraction and immediately refine it into a simple problem to solve, ""how to we use our APIs to give students the ability to control the personal data in their own domain."" That's where we come in (the we is kinda royal here, I'm just the blogger). Over lunch the discussion continued, and Phil, Kelly, and Troy Martin basically told us how excited they were about working with us to try and marry the abstract University API to the specific and personal domain. What's more, they encouraged us. It's amazing how generative some genuine interest and encouragement can be. After lunch I prepared for a talk I was giving to the campus community about ""Digital Genealogies and Sovereign Source Identity"" (more on that in a forthcoming post) and Tim caught some major inspiration.  Over the course of that afternoon and into the early evening Tim and I talked through, worked on, and even began to prototype an API-driven community site. Things fell into place for us. The UMW community site at UMW Domains is more than a year old, and Tim and Martha Burtis put that together in a couple of days with duct tape, FeedWordPress, and three Hail Marys. As we were showing it off to the BYU folks that morning several of the pages and many of the links just didn't work. Even more of a reason for us to make sense of how we can start to bridge the data we collect and visualize for the community site using API calls. The community site prototype that Martha and Tim built accomplished everything it needed to: it recast web hosting as a fish tank rather than a black box. What we realized that afternoon was that our job now was to re-architect the community site for BYU so that it can provide all the data we get in the UMW Domains site now (recent posts, term, course, department, instructor, status, software, etc.) through API calls.  Tim started playing with the CPanel API immediately, and once he gets going it is a thing of beauty to behold. Upon creation of any new web hosting account on BYU Domains an api subdomain is created, such as api.timlovesapis.com. This will be the place where we start writing to the personal API. What's more, Tim also figured out how to get Known installed by default in the root of every new account for BYU Domains using CPanel's APIs (not live for everyone just yet). So, when creating a domain on BYU Domains, the first thing a student will see is not CPanel, but a customized interface of Known that will be their personal API of sorts. They can integrate their various social media using Known's Convoy, quickly post files, but also make some basic calls to CPanel to create subdomains, install applications, etc.  Known becomes the interface for their initial domain experience, with the option of accessing CPanel at anytime. And when they install WordPress in Installatron it will automatically write course, term, software, status, etc. to their personal API file. What's more, if they are installing WordPress (which a majority will) the JSON-API plugin will automatically activate (at least until it is core) and write information like their recent posts, tags, etc. to their personal API file. So, the student has an API that lists all posts, subdomains, software installed, term(s), instructor(s), department(s), etc. Structured data they can now use to organize their career as a student, and the community can call to frame the experience in aggregate.  The next morning we did a demo for Troy, and I think we realized that Known provides a crucial bridge for the personal API vision here. If Known is the default interface for BYU Domains, it already has an API baked in, and it integrates students' various social media sites from around the web. Known is the layer we build the API calls to CPanel through a simplified dashboard, as well as double down on integrating a contextualized reader into Known that enables the community to start following other people's work based on structured relationships. Think a Tumblr like interface for all posts for a certain course that can be organized into columns à la Tweetdeck. Or all posts across a department, faculty member, Twitter, Facebook, etc. The community site as imagined through Known with a contextualized reader that enables you to personalize the way you experience the flow of data.  How can we do this? Well, by partnering with Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey of Known who will be working with us to design the interface and API hooks for BYU's community portal. I am hopeful that this will be the groundwork for establishing an entirely new interface for personal web hosting across all the institutional sites using Reclaim Hosting (as well as a long-term relationship between Known and Reclaim!). It is really exciting stuff, and if it pans out the way we're imagining, it marks a pretty dramatic shift in making web hosting, managing your personal data, and structuring your online existence that much more integrated. I can't even begin to tell you how lucky we are to have the good folks at BYU's Office of Information Technology pushing us to innovate wildly. They are remarkably open and willing to help us experiment along these lines, without ever shutting down the conversation in regards to what could go wrong, or what might or might not be kosher. They are in fully exploratory mode right alongside of us, and they have swung the doors wide open for us to see what's possible. It's like a whole new level of access for making web hosting and personal name spaces part of the ""integrated domain"" of higher ed in all the augmented-human-intellect-beauty such an Engelbartian turn of phrase draws to mind!  "Andrea Rehn,Piloting Whittier.Domains,http://andrearehn.com/blog/launching-whittier-domains/,10/10/2015,"As of the end of August, 2015, DigLibArts is now offering self-hosting to our students, faculty, and campus academic organizations through Jim Groom and Tim Owen's amazing Reclaim Hosting service. We are piloting the project Fall 2015 and hope to roll it out either Spring 2016 or Fall 2016 to the wider campus community.  Whittier Domains front page  For Fall 2015 only DigLibArts' Steering Committee members have been offered their own domains, with the proviso that they do as much as possible with their installs to help us discover where the kinks might be, where we will run into management questions, etc. I've been having a lot of fun migrating my own site from wordpress.com and exploring the many other CMS's I can use via my C-Panel.  Anne Cong-Huyen is managing the Domain project, and it has gone very well so far, despite the inevitable hiccups. Our campus single sign-on is not completing the full handshake with Domain yet, which has caused a lot of administrative work for Anne. For each new domain, currently Anne has to enter all the user data by hand. This will clearly need to be resolved before we can offer the service on a wider basis across campus.  We also are discovering a number of questions about where content should live:    1. Should student clubs be allowed to launch their own domains, or should they be housed in the student life system OrgSync, which enables some web presence and builds in smooth transfers of leadership, but does not provide the same data privacy?   2. What about student media, including the campus newspaper, Youtube channels, radio, yearbook, etc?   3. What about academic staff members? Is there any reason not to offer them the same freedom that faculty and students would enjoy via self-hosted domains? Who should pay for domain space, and how should the institution fund this on an ongoing basis?   4. Should DigLibArts's web presence itself reside on our Domain service, or should our central hub pages remain part of the campus website and servers?   5. Should academic departments be able to have their own domains (in addition to their pages on the university site)? What about departmental student honor societies? Or should those entities be hosted by the campus-wide servers?  Many of these questions have been addressed by other campuses that are a year or more into their Domain hosting experiences. David Morgan at Emory University has been enormously helpful as we began imagining how to implement our own DoOO installation, and we regularly consult his helpful documentation. Adam Croom at University of Oaklahoma has shared lots of resources on his blog and their hub pages. The good folks at CSU Channel Islands have a lovely interface and resources. Jim and Tim themselves have spent endless hours patiently answering emails and trying to sort out our various IT glitches during the initial launch.  I would absolutely love to talk with others who have launched or are about to launch their own DoOO projects about the nuts-and-bolts implementation decisions we face, as well as about the larger implications for academic freedom, university branding, and data privacy.  What do you think? Could the DoOO campuses unite for some conversations?  "pfaffman,A Domain of One's Own,https://literatecomputing.com/t/a-domain-of-ones-own/1677,10/18/2015,"Audrey Watters, posted a piece called ""The Web We Need to Give Students25"". You should go there, now, and read her post. No. Really. Go read it. It's about 1700 words; that's about 6 minutes. There she describes the University of Mary Washington's Domain of One's Own9 initiative. Students there can, at no cost to themselves, register their own domain, which the University will host while they are students. When students graduate, the domain stays in their possession and they can keep their domain and all of the data when they go. Did you read it? For the TL;DR18 crowd, I will quote this section: Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web, to have their scholarship be meaningful and accessible by others. It allows them to demonstrate their learning to others beyond the classroom walls. To own one's domain gives students an understanding of how Web technologies work. It puts them in a much better position to control their work, their data, their identity online. Given that I, for the first time since 1995, work at a university where neither students nor faculty can run their own servers on the school's internet connection, I do not see my university being so ""radical"" any time soon. So, I recommend that you make your own radical move. Register your own domain. Set up your very own wordpress.org server. There are lots of ways to do this, but one that I would recommend is Reclaim Hosting27. Using this link43 or entering ""literatecomputing"" as a Promotional code will give you 20% off and give me a 10% credit.) For $25 ($20 with discount) you can register a domain and get hosting for a whole year. This is a great deal, and cheaper than most textbooks. It is possible to get free hosting for a year with Amazon AWS4; it is a great thing to learn to do, but it is complicated. Before I tried out Reclaim Hosting, I read a few reviews of the site, including this one from a professor of a journalism course9. ISD581 used it Spring of 2016 and I was pleased with how it worked. Should you have your own domain name and server? I have had some type of server on the internet since before I started grad school in 1995. I know I'm not a Normal Person, but I nevertheless think that owning your own domain name is a good thing for most everyone, and knowing how to run your own Wordpress site is also a useful thing to be acquainted with. At the very least, when some tech person tells you that it is too hard or otherwise can't be done, you will know better. Reclaim Hosting27's shared hosting is all that most people will need. Even if you already have a wordpress.com blog, I recommend that you pay your $25 (or $20 using the here) and get your own domain and install Wordpress. Again, this link43 will give you a discount. (If it says $25 enter the promotional code: ""literatecomputing"". I think that it should take about half an hour. Note: This is a different (and better) thing than hosting your blog at Wordpress.com. There are lots of other applications that you can (and likely will) install. What Hosting Service to Use I recommend Reclaim Hosting27, because It is inexpensive. It is easy to use. Everyone else in your class will be using it, so you can get help. If you want to use some other service, or already have a host set up and it will enable you to install Wordpress7, Known, Moodle3 and Scalar, on your subdomains (e.g., moodle.yourdomain.com) you can give that a try. **If, however, you choose to use some other service and subsequently cannot accomplish some challenge because of that choice, you will receive a zero for this assignment.** For a frame of reference, I am an experienced system administrator and maintained a Moodle server for nearly a decade. For me, setting up Moodle would take me between 10 and 30 minutes. Using Cpanel on reclaimhosting.com, it would take less than five. What Domain Name Should I Choose? Unfortunately, all the good names are taken. That said, if you are comfortable having your name attached to your site, try to get some version of your name. You may choose to use this domain to develop a portfolio, so a professional-sounding name is a good idea. But I already have a domain! Even if you already have something like yourname.com with some site on it, I recommend that you choose some other name to use for your work here. It costs no more to get a new domain, and having Reclaim Hosting managing both your domain makes things easier. If you choose to do it some other way, you are on your own. Managing Your Internet Server It is a good bet that you have not ever managed a server on the internet. It is a little like controlling a marionette via strings and wires that you push and pull. The computer that you are controlling rather than being in the same room with you is somewhere on the internet. You don't know where. How do you figure out how to install Wordpress on Reclaim Hosting? Like this31, which will lead you to Reclaim Hosting's Installing WordPress page31. Follow those directions. What to do Register your own domain on reclaimhosting.com43. You should get a 20% ($5) discount. If you do not, and would like a discount, you can enter literatecomputing in the promo code field. Set up Wordpress at yourdomain.com (not yourdomain.com/wordpress). You can poke around ""cpanel"" to add domains and install web applications. Edit or delete the ""Hello, world!"" post so that something different is there. Extra cool points for configuring ""Let's Encrypt SSL"" and giving your site an https secure connection (it's free!).

I spent the bulk of my time in Los Angeles, but also spent two days at Stanford University for the dLRN conference. This post was inspired by the presentation I did with Adam Croom at dLRN. But since starting this post I gave a follow-up presentation on Indie EdTech at Whittier College, and I'm currently preparing a third version to present at Librecon later today. So, what started as a reflection about my presentation with Adam has transformed into a far ranging exploration of this idea of Indie EdTech ? so please forgive the inconsistencies and omissions.  Palo Alto was an interesting spot for the presentation Adam Croom and I came up with for this conference because it's ground zero for mainstream visions of tech culture more generally (Google anyone?). What's more, the same can be said for edtech after the Fall 2011 AI course at Stanford taught by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig got called a MOOC. This was the course that launched 1000 MOOCs, effectively mainstreaming edtech (the year that edtech broke ? in both senses of that word). The context was not lost on us, and we decided to use the occasion to introduce something Adam has coined ""Indie EdTech""  ? which I love!  Before the talk, Adam and I got the opportunity to warm up for our presentation a bit when we were invited by Maha Bali to do a Virtually Connecting chat a couple of hours before our talk. The session included Autumm Caines, Apostolos K, Patrice Torcivia Prusko (onsite Buddy), resident punk expert GZ, Kelsey Schmitz, and Jack Norton, and Christian from Hamburg (didn't get his last name). You can watch/listen to the session in the video below.  Our chat ran long at 30 minutes, but we found it an great way to try out our ideas, warm up the conversation, and connect with folks beyond the conference. The Virtually Connecting phenomenon is very cool, and after this experience I am sold on it ? at least from the vantage point of a presenter. On the other side, major kudos to all those who both organized and participated in the session. Coordinating stuff like this is a ton of work, but provides an invaluable, interactive portal into a conference like dLRN. Not to mention an alternative archive of the event.  But back to the actual talk. The first part of our 30 minute talk (which was supposed to be 15) was delivered brilliantly by Adam, who discussed the history digital music to examine the impact of the web on the changing nature of that industry, its consumers, and the artist. It's a really sharp, paleoconnectivist analysis of the real impacts behind the claims at the turn of the millennium that the web and file sharing was killing the music industry. Turns out it was transforming the distribution of wealth and access for artists, but the industry is alive and well. A powerful statement that flies in the face of claims like those of Metallica's Lars Ulrich about digital music destroying an industry. I highly recommend you visit Adam's site for his entire talk. [As a quick aside, is their anyone doing the level of work Adam is right now to galvanize an entire University community to take control of their online world? I have been blown away but what he has accomplished at Oklahoma over the last year. amazing.]  The long history of music and culture that Adam explored in relationship to tech and music since the 1960s opened up a ton of possibilities for analyzing specific examples of artists' challenging the established culture in order to try and fashion their own. I've been looking for every opportunity to incorporate Michael Azerrad's fascinating book Our Band Could be Your Life (a chronicle of U.S. Independent punk bands during the 1980s) into a presentation ? and thiswas my chance!  My idea behind the presentation was pretty simple, and I think it worked out decently (though it still needs a lot of work). Take specific indie bands from the 80s that Azerrad talks about in his book and juxtapose them with the development of an independent movement in edtech over the last decade. I'll acknowledge right away that the limits of this presentation were that I focused a bit too specifically on stuff I was a part of at UMW (UMW Blogs, EDUPUNK, ds106, Domains, etc.). I tried to rectify this issue when I presented a second version of this talk the following week at Whittier College, but need to build this out.  Below is an edited version of my slides, and I went through them fast with some cursory discussion about the bands and the correlating Punk scene (we only had 15 minutes total, which we stretched into 15 minutes each). So, my commentary below is not the presentation I gave as much as the presentation I would have loved to have given if I had the time and had prepared.I guess my blog posts aren't the only anarchic works-in-progress I'm responsible for:)  Why 1980s indie punk? First and foremost because I dig it. But secondly it provides an interesting parallel for what we might consider Indie Edtech. Indie punk represents a staunchly independent, iconoclastic, and DIY approach to music which encompasses many of the principles we aspired to when creating open, accessible networks for teaching and learning at UMW. Make it open source, cheap, and true alternatives to the pre-packaged learning management systems that had hijacked innovation. The rise of the venture capital xMOOCs only reinforced that value of such an ethos.  Black Flag  Writing about the cultural conditions that gave birth to the hardcore movement, Azerrad focuses on Souther California and the L.A. band Black Flag which represents the beginning of a whole new generation of punk:  > It's not surprising that the indie movement largely started in Southern California ? after all, it had the infrastructure: Slash and Flipside fanzines started in 1977, and indie labels like Frontier and Posh Boy and Dangerhouse started soon afterward. KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer played the region's punk music on his show; listeners could buy what they heard thanks to various area distributors and record shops and see the bands at places like the Masque, the Starwood, the Whisky, the Fleetwood, and various impromptu venues. And there were great bands like the Germs, Fear, the Dickies, the Dils, X, and countless others. No other region in the country had quite as good a setup. But by 1979 the original punk scene had almost completely died out. Hipsters had moved on to arty post-punk bands like the Fall, Gang of Four, and Joy Division. They were replaced by a bunch of toughs coming in from outlying suburbs who were only beginning to discover punk's speed, power, and aggression. They didn't care that punk rock was already being dismissed as a spent force, kid bands playing at being the Ramones a few years too late.  And what was unique about Black Flag, according to Azerrad, is that: ""Black Flag was among the first bands to suggest that if you didn't like ïthe system,' you should simply create one of your own."" And Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn did just that when he founded and ran SST Records.] The band itself was ""required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music."" More from Azerrad:  > By virtue of their [Black Flag's] relentless touring, the band did more than any other to blaze a trail through America that all kinds of bands could follow. Not only did they establish punk rock beachheads in literally every corner of the country; they inspired countless other bands to form and start doing it for themselves. The band's selfless work ethic was a model for the decade ahead, overcoming indifference, lack of venues, poverty, even police harassment.  I'm fascinated by the idea here that Black Flag could forge an independent punk movement on sheer will and hard work. Not sure if that's the whole story, but I love the narrative regardless. And it provides a nice transition to what was UMW's DTLT. Below is the image/slide I used that captures four core group members that are in many ways the Black Flag of Indie EdTech ?? Early on DTLT decided that rather than existing within the confines of the learning management systems that defined main stream edtech, we would build a system of their own. And that is exactly what we did for the following decade. In fact, we built a few ?? We weren't in metropolitan Los Angeles, however, but rather in Civilwarland, VA. A regional public liberal arts school few people had heard of outside of Virginia. All it took was punk rock denier Gardner Campbell to unleash the Bluehost experiment as well as hooking us up with various edtech punks around the country such as Bryan Alexander, Alan Levine, D'Arcy Norman, and the great Brian Lamb.  DTLT (Edtech's Black Flag!)  The initial push for experimentation and exploration at DTLT in 2004 and 2005 pre-dates my time at UMW, and would prove foundational for everything that would follow. And, to be clear, and this is a point Azerrad makes repeatedly in his book, punk is not necessarily a pre-defined look, political stance, or reaction, but a fervent independence from the established approach to making music in the 80s that defined the industry. And this was certainly one of the things that drew me to this analogy.  Mission of Burma  Case in point, rather than the aggressive, antisocial, and paranoid themes of Black Flag, Boston's Mission of Burma took ""elements of free jazz, psychedelia, and experimental music and injected them into often anthemic punk rock."" It was avant-garde meets punk rock ? a vision bands like Sonic Youth would build upon a few short years later. The were experimental all the way, so much so that one of their band members, Martin Swope, worked as the group's tape-effects artist incorporating tape work to most of the group's songs, and was regarded as an integral part of the group, appearing in group photographs and receiving equal credit on recordings although he was never on stage.  The Blue Host Experiment  That kind of experimentation with various forms and technologies was what the Bluehost experiment was all about. Experiment with fledgling (at the time) open source tools like WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, etc. and try and create a new system all our own by building course environments for faculty and students that put them on the web, and asked them to take a hand in designing the experience.All at the low cost of $6 a month ? the going rate for consumer- level commodity hosting in 2005.  Minor Threat  Washington D.C.'s Minor Threat (taking inspiration from the great Bad Brains) came on the scene, and they gave birth to a movement within the movement: straight edge. Minor Threat repudiated the idea of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and promiscuous sex in reaction to the 70s punk rockers, as well as the burnt out threat that was the hippie movement. Founding band member Ian Mackaye also started Dischord Records which had a strong influence on the hardcore punk scene by reinforcing a ""do it yourself"" (DIY) ethic for music distribution and concert promotion. What's more, there was more than just SST now. Different regions could have their own labels and build their own, unique culture for their local scene.  UMW Blogs  In many ways building this idea of local culture for UMW was the spirit behind UMW Blogs. The first major result of consistent experimentation was a campus- wide publishing platform on top of the open source blogging software WordPress. This might be understood as a label of sorts for the great work coming out of UMW, and we weren't alone. There were already blogging platforms at UBC and Penn State that were doing something similar, and this became a link for a broader community of indie edtech folks experimenting outside the blackbox that was the LMS.  EDUPUNK: DIY EDTECH  As some of you may know, this isn't the first time I've played with the idea of punk in relationship to edtech. And it's not a coincidence I'm returning to it now. Much of the spirit of the work happening in UMW up and until 2008 seemed to be fairly radical for the field. Learning management Systems were the rule, and edtech was often framed in service to that system. EDUPUNK refused that paradigm, and UMW's DTLT became an example of how to do it differently. In 2008 you could count the number of schools who were running and supporting WordPress for their campus community on two hands, in 2015 it would probably take 200 hands. Not only was WordPress open source, but it wasn't even Moodle. It was blogging software! While EDUPUNK went underground as it became a rationale for gutting public spending for higher ed, and disrupting education more generally, it spirit lived on.  The Minutemen  Much like that of D. Boone and the inimitable Minutemen, the spirit of The Minutemen was a staunchly left politic buttressed by an intense work ethic and a parsimonious rock and roll lifestyle captured brilliantly in their calling card: ""we jam econo."" Their musical style was as bluesy as it was punk, and they represent yet another node in broad vision of what punk was in the 80s. They were their own roadies, toured tirelessly, and were considered my many the exemplars of the DIY ethos of the early indie punk scene, not to mention its moral compass ? but without all the overt preaching and doctrine of the straight edge scene.  ds106 #4life  So when ds106 (the Digital Storytelling course at UMW), went open and online in the Spring of 2011, a variety of folks came together to design a participatory, open, online course that would try and distill the ethos of indie edtech, while at the same time capturing its community. All the while doing just about everything on open, freely available (or at least dirt cheap) infrastructure. Grant Potter gave the course the tagline ""we jam econo""  ? and it stuck. He also built a radio station for the course ? truly exemplifying the best of open and ongoing experimentation in edtech. ds106 marks a kinda of distributed crystallization of the indie edtech scene post-EDUPUNK. A couple of letters followed by a few numbers that have become the calling card for ongoing, free-flowing creativity, experimentation, and fun.  Sonic Youth  The free-flowing creativity and experimentation that characterized the independent punk scene in the 1980s took on new levels of musical sophistication with bands like NYC's Sonic Youth.  During their early career members of Sonic Youth were associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Lee Ranaldo a talented avante garde guitarist. Kim Gordon a fine artist-cum- bassist and vocalist. They were as much a noise band as a punk band, and they did a lot of work in terms of marrying the idea of avante- garde music to punk rock. They also combined the two traditions by championing the hardcore punk ethos and the DIY ethic as a genre rather than a specific sound. Why couldn't punk also be avante-garde noise? Again, another instance of punk as a social category more than a musical one, providing creative freedom for bands like Sonic Youth to roam. What's more, it enabled Sonic Youth to make the transition from indie to major labels with very little blowback from the community in terms of their commitment to the indy cause.  UMW's Domain of One's Own  And much like Sonic Youth, Domain of One's Own represented avante-garde design thinking (build the network around the individual not the course) with trailing-edge tech and a DIY ethic. This came together so brilliantly when Tim Owens (DTLT's Lee Renaldo) and Martha Burtis (Kim Gordon) sat down in 2012 and 2013 and built out the basics that had already been prototyped with Hippie Hosting (I hated that name ?? ). The vision around the Bluehost experiment that started the whole thing was taken to a whole new level of elegance and usability. It was the culmination of all the explorations that fueled the Bluehost experiment, UMW Blogs, EDUPUNK, and ds106 rolled into user innovation toolkit known as Domain of One's Own. The fruit of years of focused work towards a common goal of empowering a community created and controlled web at UMW. It's punk rock to the core. And like Sonic Youth, it could abstract out its value to appeal more broadly to other schools who were keen on doing something similar for themselves.  Emory Domains  For example, very early on in 2013 Emory was planning on on running a pilot for their writing classes. A vision where writing across the curriculum meets writing for the web. New idea of audience, literacy, and a broader vision of the writing portfolio. David Morgen has led this charge adroitly, and has been steadily building a culture of domains at Emory for more than two years.  From the Spring of 2013 through the Summer of 2014 the broader Indie EdTech domains movement started to congeal. We became heavily influenced by the thinking of Audrey Watters and Kin Lane, and around this time (thanks to Audrey and Kin) became familiar with and inspired by the parallel work happening in the IndieWeb movement. Audrey and Kin in many ways helped shape the direction and momentum of domains, as well as our philosophy of the IndieWeb more generally (kinda like a John Doe and Exene Cervenka ? a heavily dosed, duet of O.G. LA EdTech that never gets old).  The Summer of 2014 also saw the signing on of schools like University of Oklahoma, Davidson College, and Cal State University-Channel Islands. The idea of a Domain of One's Own was spreading across the country. And each of these schools had their own idea of what it might look like, and just like punk music, the idea of domains was not an orthodox approach, but a DIY ethos and ""we jam econo"" vision of edtech. Like the various bands throughout the 1980s independent music scene, they would ultimately create their own sound based on their local scene. And the universities making this possible are akin to indie edtech labels across the country in the 1980s (SST Records, Dischord Records, Touch & Go,K Records, Twin/Tone, Sub Pop, etc.) fostering a new approach to teaching and learning with technology that flies in the face of mainstream edtech ? and all on the cheap.  Initially you might not think of a band like The Flaming Lips as part the 1980s indie music scene, but they are very much part and parcel of that movement. Founded in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983, they recorded their first full- length album, Hear It Is, in 1986 on Enigma Records. Far from what you think of us as punk, The Flaming Lips were a tripped out, psychedelic rock band. What's interesting is they hailed from Oklahoma, and essentially forged a scene in Oklahoma City around their unique stye.  The Flaming Lips  Much like The Flaming Lips, Mark Morvant and Adam Croom from University of Oklahoma immediately dug into the idea of domains, and quickly built a scene around this project at Oklahoma. The work they have done with their domains project, OU Create, is as lush and multi-layered as the Flaming Lips sounds. After a year of piloting their project, it has become something their IT department is not only supporting, but providing to anyone interested in lieu of the tilde spaces, which are soon-to-be retired. Within a year  University of Oklahoma's OU Create  Possibly my favorite chapter in Micahel Azerrad's Our Band Could be Your Life was the final one on the little know Olympia, Washington band Beat Happening. The chapter outlines how by the end of the 1980s and early 90s the idea of the independent music scene in the US had come a long way from Black Flag. Rather than a muscle-bound maniacs barking lyrics and insults at the crowd, you had a coy, 50s throwback group of lo-fi musicians focusing on teenage love. As Azerrad notes, ""Beat Happening were a major force in widening the idea of a punk rocker from a mohawked guy in a motorcycle jacket to a nerdy girl in a cardigan sweater."" What's more, Calvin Johnson, Heather Lewis, and Brent Lunsford, were the force behind the scene. Johnson started the label K Records which would be the inspiration for so many of the bands that would come out of Olympia, and the Northwest more generally: Bratmobile, Bikini Kill, Sleater- Kinney, Seaweed, Unwound, and Nirvana.  Beat Happening  Kristen Eshleman and Mark Sample provide a quite interesting parallel here. They have been building a focused, wide-ranging community around domains from students to faculty and beyond. Davidson students like Andrew Rickard are openly challenging some of the rhetoric around domains, and making the work they do better as a result. They are also digging deep on what the contours of their community are, what are the bottlenecks, and how they build something real and meaningful for teaching and learning. Sample and Eshleman are like Johnson and Lewis building a sustainable vision of Domains for their community that is taking root as part of their liberal arts culture.  Davidson Domains  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Cal State University, Channel Islands was the third school to follow suit, and I've already written about their questioning of the conformity curve, and they brought a unique dimension to domains early on: A Subdomain of One's Own. The idea that a student or university doesn't have to pay for a domain just yet to play with the affordances of web hosting. it makes the whole thing that much cheaper for an institution to do without the domain. While certain elements get lost with a subdomain, students and faculty still have the option to buy and map their own if they would like. This was a big moment for our ability to provide domains infrastructure to schools at prices so low they almost couldn't say no ??  But this is all the beginning, the last year we have witnessed so real momentum in regards to various schools running their own domains initiative. Charles Sturt University in Australia was our very first international school, and thanks to the great Tim Klapdor, we were able to run it on Australian based servers through AWS, which was a first for us. What's more, the platform is the playground for thinking about what could be possible at Charles Sturt University more broadly for the future. Blue sky meets R&D.  Charles Sturt University's uImagine  The work BYU has been doing with their domain project is truly cutting edge. They are working with Reclaim Hosting and Ben and Erin of Known fame to create personal APIs for their entire community. It may be the most ambitious project we have seen yet, and the thinking of folks like Kelly Flanagan, Phil Windley, and Troy Martin is IT punk through and through! We are close to showing off how Reclaim and Known will be the piece that feeds the personal API, and also starts connecting the broader API plumbing BYU has architecting on their campus for well over a year. This is crazy exciting work, and a whole new genre where indie edtech meets indie web apps and APIs!  BYU Domains  And after all of this the Indie Edtech scene is just getting started. What are you doing about it on your campus? I have much, much more to write and many other campuses to feature, but this post has been two weeks in the making already, and represents a look at everything I wanted to say at dLRN15 and Whittier, but wasn't yet fully baked. So take this as a more focused attempt at trying to frame what I think is a broader movement afoot in edtech. The underground innovation that I firmly believe will prove to be the ideas and architecture that influences and frames the shape of teaching and learning ecosystems in the not so distant future.  Hope springs eternal in the bava breastƒ.  "Jim Groom,Reclaiming Community at BYU with Known,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaiming-community-at-byu-with-known/,11/11/2015,"BYU's Community Portal  We've been really lucky at Reclaim Hosting over the last year two years to have had the good fortune of working with the good folks at Emory University, University of Oklahoma, CSU Channel Islands, and Davidson College. These four schools have believed in what we're trying to do from the start, and they've been as much partners and collaborators as clients. What's so cool is that it has not stopped with them. The work we have been doing with Brigham Young University's IT department over the last 6 months represents an exciting continuation of Reclaim's partnership with universities to help co-create and implement a vision of what's possible. What's more, Reclaim's not working alone on this one, we have finally been able to get serious and work hand-in- hand with Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey at Known to make these visions a reality. But I'm getting ahead of myself here, let me back up a bitƒ  Last Winter BYU's CIO Kelly Flanagan and Enterprise Architect Phil Windley came to UMW to find out more about Domain of One's Own. They have been working on a broader project to define a University API across their campus, and they saw personal domains and web hosting as a way of providing students spaces to manage and control their data in a space of their own. Kelly Flanagan has recently written a post, ""Personal Domains, APIs, and Portfolios,"" that captures the spirit of their project, and pushes to the very limits of decentralized data ownership viz-a-viz a personal API:  > Imagine a world where other sites on the web don't hold your personal data, but instead request access to the data they need through your Personal API. Perhaps you grant them access to only the portions they actually need and restrict them from others. They use the resources they've been authorized to access, perform the business functions you desire, return results, and their access is revoked.  This is a perfect marriage with BYU's University API project, and represents about as vast and ambitious a vision for fundamentally rethinking Higher Ed IT I've yet to come across in my 10 years of instructional technology. But actually creating such a vision starts in small, concrete ways. When we were showing Kelly and Phil Domain of One's Own community site, that became a focus for BYU. They were very interested in building that for their pilot, and they signed on for it over the summer. The issue was the community site Martha Burtis and Tim built almost two years ago is beginning to show its age and neglect (less is not always more). Trying to reproduce what was created as a prototype at UMW for schools working with Reclaim didn't make much sense. It wasn't easily abstracted out; Martha has been promoted up to grander things, and we needed to come to terms with the fact that we aren't software developers. We can help imagine and create the infrastructure, but we need to start brining folks into the equation who specialize in developing specific applications like this ? particularly if BYU's community hub is going to support the Personal API vision.  So, in late September Tim and I traveled out to BYU to have just this conversation around the Personal API, and how a re-imagined community hub might be the first piece of that puzzle. The trip was a great success for Tim and I because we made some real headway on the initial vision of an API-driven community site. What we came away with was not only BYU's continued support on this project ? they rule! ? , but also the go-ahead to bring in Ben and Erin of Known to start building BYU's community hub on top of Known.  What does this mean exactly? Well, that's the fun part. Known already has an API built-in, so if Domains at BYU ""beings with the Known"" (to quote the great Adam Croom) the entire experience changes. For example, what would it mean if when you signed up for BYU Domains the first thing you saw was not CPanel, but an on-boarding process that begins with the option of integrating your various social media services through Known.  Connect your Social Media through Known's Convoy  What's more, once you have done that, you default to a page that is a quick and easy publishing space to send your various work to your social media accounts (the personal API at work already).  The Known Dashboard in BYU Domains  So, as you can see this post in the default page for my BYU Domain becomes a means of pushing to my WordPress blog, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. All this being handled by Known's Convoy, which does the work of connecting your domain with these various social media sites automatically. Now, by extension, there is no reason this can't integrate with BYU's University API. There could be buttons underneath the various post types that allow students to send their work to a particular class using something like Canvas's API.  Privacy matters  What's more, built into each post are various privacy settings: Public, Members only (limited to the BYU community), and Private. [When talking to Tony Hirst about this, he recommended a fourth type called ""off-campus"" which allows students to post to their social media sites from Known, but not have it aggregated to the community site. I like that idea.] But where is this community site you speak of? Well, built into every students dashboard is a Community link.  Toggle to view community posts  And when I click on that I can see what is happening around the BYU Community within your stream. Not unlike Tumblr. You'll notice my domain is now showing me Kelly's post about Domains.  Posts from community read in my Domain  The reader is a view of the community, but ultimately much more once we get targeted data via APIs. it can be a view of all the posts from one course, all the post from your Facebook community, all the public posts to Facebook from the BYU domains community, same goes for Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. (hence why the ""off campus"" feature in privacy setting could be OUseful). A targeted, community based reader of sorts that integrates course and distributed social media based on tags and data. A vision of aggregation heretofore only dreamed of in our edtech philosophy.  BYU Community Site Directory  What some of those tags and features might be is loosely framed in the site directory feature of the BYU Community site Ben and Erin have built, but that is only limited by how BYU wants to use their University API to integrate with the Personal API.  Elastic search in BYU's community hub.  You can also search across specific content types, but this could easily be extended to search across social media sites, departments, courses, etc.  The work Erin and Ben have done on the Community Hub for BYU is phenomenal, and this is just the beginning. BYU's community hub provides a model that we can now abstract and provide to other interested schools, and partnering with Known on this may very well changed the way we imagine Domains not only as personal empowerment online, but also community engagement.  Now, having Known as the default interface for BYU Domains in no way rules out the ability for users to install other applications, subdomains, etc. We are currently thinking through what's the best way to provide a quick and easy way to create subdomains or install WordPress, as well as a simple means of toggle to CPanel to work from there. That said, the switch could be a major one for communities used to working in CPanel, so we to think intently about what this means for the community at large, and what works and what doesn't. But thanks to BYU's willingness to experiment, we have a partner that is helping us work through these questions currently, and we may have answers to some of these questions as soon as January.  These are very exciting times for Reclaim Hosting. It cool to see the visions we've been courting as a community for years and years start to take shape in an actual application built upon the values of an open and independent web.  "Jim Groom,What has WordPress Ever Done for Us?,http://bavatuesdays.com/what-has-wordpress-ever-done-for-us/,12/1/2015,"> Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?  >  > PFJ Member: Brought peace?  >  > Reg: Oh, peace? SHUT UP!  While WordPress hasn't brought peace just yet, it certainly has helped power huge swaths of the web ? 25% of all sites according to recent counts. And when Andrea Rennick reached out asking how WordPress has changed their life I thought almost immediately about the above scene from Monty Python's Life of Brian when Reg (John Cleese) starts off asking, ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"", only to get a laundry list of positive things in response. Similarly, when preparing to answer Andrea's simple question with my critical glasses on, I quickly came up with a long list of things WordPress has done that has changed my personal and professional life for the better. So, let me beginƒ  When I first heard of WordPress in 2004 I was teaching high school in Brooklyn. I had been making old gold HTML pages for my classes, and my friend Zach Davis told me about this open source application I could install on my web hosting account that would make posting a lot easier. It was around the time when blogging was start to get popular, and I was fairly skeptical of the whole thing. That said, my oldest son had just been born, and we were looking for a way to share pictures and videos with our family in Italy. WordPress quickly became a solution to this, and it sent me down the rabbit hole of figuring out how a PHP/MySQL driven site works. That was all magic to me prior to 2004 and WordPress was the gateway drug. Out of this experimentation Planet Miles was born in 2005.  At the same time I had left my job as a high school teacher in Brooklyn and started working as an Instructional Technology Fellow at CUNY's Honors College. Between finishing my dissertation, teaching high school full time, and becoming a new dad something had to give, and the first to go was teaching high school. The dissertation wasn't far behind though ?? That CUNY fellowship, which was initially a means to the end of finishing my dissertation, quickly became a portal to a whole new world of instructional technology. I remember Zack Davis pulled up Stephen Downes's blog/newsletter the OL Daily at one of our first meetings talking about this crazy educational technologist from Canada who provided a great orientation point for someone new to the field like myself. Little did I know how important that crazy Canadian's work and thinking would be to my own over the next ten years. What's more, I later found out Downes had been down a similar path to mine in terms of his career in edtech.  It was about that time (January/February of 2005) when I began my long, illustrious career peddling WordPress in higher ed. I had been playing with WordPress for a few months by then fine-tuning Planet Miles, and I figured it was time to try see if we couldn't use something similar for classes that would provide a much simpler, customizable experience than BlackBoard (the LMS of choice at CUNY). I was struck by the idea that you could customize both the header image and sidebar of a WordPress blog with fairly little HTML and PHP hacking knowledge (this was the early days of the Kubrick theme, long before widgets and upload-able/resize-able header images). I learned a ton about how the ""new web"" worked. I learned how PHP makes calls to a database for specific information that can then be dynamically rendered in HTML. I learned how CSS was used to cascade styles across potentially thousands of dynamically created HTML pages that effectively separate function and form. These were two of the earlier revolutionary concepts that I was exposed to as an instructional technologist that helped me conceptualization how the web was changing in the early 2000s.  I had my first blogging workshop in March of 2005 wherein I got students and faculty on Blogger. I was never a huge fan of that system given I started from a position of being able to hack my own self-hosted blog, but it was hard not to be amazed that you could create a website so quickly and easily with Blogger. It was a sign that posting online no longer had to be a chore; it could actually be easy and elegant. And that was the start of the long love affair with WordPress because unlike Blogger, WordPress was something you controlled (this was just before the creation of WordPress.com). I could edit the header.php file on my web server to include a picture of a Smurf in the Planet Miles's header. I could integrate albums from this new fangled photo site Flickr into a WordPress page using a plugin (remember Joe Tan's TanTan Flickr anyone?). It was an infrastructure that provided a pseudo, wanna-be tech person like myself a real platform to start from and build on. It struck me that if it could help someone like me gain a deeper understanding of how the web works, then why couldn't it do the same for faculty and students ? a fairly simple vision that still drives the work I do today.  And that might be a good place to transition because during the Fall of 2015 I had convinced a couple of professors to use WordPress for their course sites instead of BlackBoard. The students were posting their work to a blog page. (We figured out how to make the default homepage a static page thanks to a hack we got from the forums.) It was an open, accessible learning management system, and it had the benefit of being a real web-based resource and having its own style/personality.  At the same time, all that I had learned over the previous 6 months turned into a way for my family and I to leave NYC and actually move somewhere affordable with a steady income, benefits, etc. The idea was that Antonella and I could get some breathing room and actually finish our dissertations. Turns out University of Mary Washington (UMW) was looking for an instructional technologist with some LAMP server chops (which thanks to playing with WordPress I had) to experiment with open source applications like, you guessed it, WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, etc. It was a very forward-looking positon at the time, and I kinda stumbled on to it. But, in retrospect, it would eventually define the next decade of my life, and WordPress was very much at its core.  Our work with WordPress at UMW has a long, rich history. I have chronicled much of it already on this blog (proudly powered by WordPress), which, by the way, I started on my first day of work. Bavatuesdays will turn ten years old in less than two weeks, and this space has seen some mileage with almost 3000 posts, 13,000 comments, and a coupla million page views over that time period. Modest stats in the big picture, but truly amazing when you think about the fact this blog started out ? and has pretty much remained ? a small outpost on the web where I openly share what I think and learn about edtech, movies, GIFs, books, etc. This blog has also been ground zero for my professional transformation, and once I got started in December of 2015, I never really stopped. It became a much needed alternative to academic writing I had learned to hate over the previous 8 years, and I was actually excited about writing again. But it was a very different kind of writing. In many ways much simpler. I was just narrating what I had learned about my work.  From 2006 through 2010 I predominantly wrote about the work I was doing with WordPress. This included building one-off WordPress sites for faculty that were loosely integrated with MediaWiki (often for creating editable syllabi and for collaborative work) in 2006; building a multi-user platform for UMW in 2007 (UMW Blogs); framing WordPress as a more humane, web-friendly alternative to the LMS à la EDUPUNK in 2008; and for much of 2009 and 2010 I went on the the road sharing the work we did at UMW using WordPress to build an alternative infrastructure for teaching and learning. All the while we were playing with syndication that enabled students and faculty to control their own work in their own space, but aggregated for the purposes of a course, etc. WordPress was the foundational open source technology we choose to build just about everything on top of at UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies and, in retrospect, we were smart and right. It was an excellent choice, and in 2011 it would drive our entire university's website. The great Cathy Derecki was one of the first to push WordPress beyond the ubiquitous dismissal used by enterprise IT folks that WordPress was ""not a real CMS, it's only a blog."" All the while the entire web was becoming more and more like a blog, and university websites were becoming more and more cumbersome and outdated.  From 2011 until 2013 were the ds106 days. We went rogue at UMW and built an entire open, online course on top of WordPress that was unique in that we were building the platform as we went along. We started with a pretty standard aggregation hub, but then added an assignment bank, daily create, inspire, remix machine, etc. And the thing is we didn't necessarily build everything ? parts of the infrastructure were created by the students ? making the shift in usability and accessibility that WordPress made possible all the more apparent. But perhaps the biggest shift in 2010 is when were able to take the elegance and ease-of-use that has made WordPress so popular to the next level for our community by requiring students in ds106 to get their own domain and web hosting and install their own WordPress sites for the course. A crash course in how the web works that I had personally undergone five years earlier. The evolution of WordPress into an easy-to-use, powerful, and elegant publishing platform over that period of time is astounding. The idea of empowering faculty and students to manage and build their own online spaces was more than rhetoric, it was a fairly quotidian reality.  A reality that was then rolled out at UMW campus-wide when Tim Owens effectively built a web hosting service for UMW that was built around WordPress. We ran it using CPanel and WHMCS, but integrated the whole environment on top of WordPress ? making it effectively the portal to the Domain of One's Own project we officially rolled out at UMW in 2015. This gave every interested student, staff, and faculty member their own domain and web hosting for the duration of their time at UMW. What's more, the vast majority of the applications installed (over 80%) were WordPress, reinforcing just how synonymous this technology had become with building web sites. So UMW had become one of the main hubs for pushing WordPress as a viable alternative for just about everything: ""sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system, and public health, etc. ""But what the hell had WordPress ever done for us?  Well, it helped change the direction of my life yet again just a couple of years ago. In July 2013 Tim Owens and I started our own web hosting company called Reclaim Hosting with the idea of supporting other universities that might want to explore the Domain of One's Own concept on their campus. We built our hosting around WordPress (it is effectively the integration point for WHMCS and CPanel), and two years later we have seen an outpouring of interest in this work. More and more universities and colleges see shared web hosting as one way of enabling faculty and students to manage their own work, create a personal space, and learn more about how the web works. What's more, WordPress continues to drive a vast amount of that work ? more than 80% on Reclaim's servers ? which is almost at 10,000 accounts.  So, I can thank WordPress for giving me a job, allowing me to define my professional identity, helping me experiment with new ways of teaching, supporting me empower faculty and students to take control of their digital identity, providing me a great business opportunity, and even enabling me to quit my day job and move my family to Italy. One might say ""WordPress MADE ME!"" But you could also say I was one of the many who helped make WordPress, which is the single greatest thing about this open source software as well as the community that drives it. You truly get out of it what you put into it. What has WordPress done for me? Well, as much as I have done for WordPress. This application embodies the virtuous circle of open software in my mind, and deciding to fall down the WordPress rabbit hole back in 2004 was, in hindsight, one of the smartest things I ever did personally and professionally. Thanks WordPress, I remain you're #1 Fan!       I also remember we had to hack the header.php file of the theme to re-arrange the order of the pages in the menu ? another feature now baked in.  "Lee Skallerup Bessette,Claiming a Domain of My Own: Choosing a Name,http://umwdtlt.com/claiming-a-domain-of-my-own/,12/3/2015,"# Claiming a Domain of My Own: Choosing a Name  December 3, 2015  |In Domain of One's Own  |By Lee Skallerup Bessette  Over the next couple weeks, Lee Skallerup Bessette, new Instructional Technology Specialist at the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies, will be blogging her way through the process she is taking while setting up her own website through Domain of One's Own.  Most people are surprised that I don't have my own personal website. I have a robust web presence through Twitter and my blog at InsideHigherEd.com, as well as my writing for platforms such as Hybrid Pedagogy, Keep Learning, and ProfHacker (according to Contently, 250k words for 17 different publications!). Because of this, I've never really felt the need (or found the time) to create my own website with my own domain name.  Now that I am at University of Mary Washington working at DTLT, it's the perfect opportunity to do just that, while at the same time, learning about Domain of One's Own. Audrey Watters, in her book Claim Your Domain ? And Your Online Presence, makes some compelling arguments around why I should, and really anyone in education fields, as well as our students, should reclaim our space on the web. This particular idea from her book resonated deeply with me:  > Life bits is a better term than data to describe all that we're creating now thanks to new technologies ƒ The term life bits might help us to recognize that all this data we're creating  ?  intentionally and unintentionally  ?  are pieces of our lives.  My online presence is literally scattered across the web, some of it behind paywalls. I've been doing content on the web since 1996 when I moved our undergraduate program's student newspaper online and started writing for my friend's webzine. Neither of the sites / spaces exist anymore; one lived on a long-dead university server while the other disappeared from the web when we forgot to renew our domain and hosting service. I often fear that this will happen to me again, or at least to my content, that I'll lose those bits of myself I have left all over the web.  The first question I need to address is: what to call my domain? What is my space on the Internet going to be called? It's not as simple a question as it seems because so much of my digital identity is tied to a very specific moment for me on the web: 2010, when I launched my blog and Twitter account associated with my (failed) online business. This is when ""readywriting"" was born, and it became my primary digital identity and identifier, purposefully working to distance myself from the ""academic"" Lee Skallerup Bessette.  Unfortunately, readywriting.com isn't available, so I also considered using my own name for my domain. This is fraught because of my double last name, which is made up of my maiden and married names. There is a long explanation for this involving immigration, but some of my academic identity online and elsewhere was formed before I was married, as well as Skallerup being a nice uncommon name that is memorable.  So some places I'm Lee Skallerup and others I'm Lee Bessette, and others still Lee Skallerup Bessette. All the more reason to create a domain of my own. Except no one can spell either of my last names correctly. And leeskallerupbessette.com is really long. What good is a domain that no one remembers how to spell? And buying up every single possible misspelling of my name would break my bank. The choice of domain is not purely an abstraction. It will be both a figurative representation of my digital identity and also, in a very practical way, how people will find me on the web.  So I've settled on readywriting.org (all you'll find there so far is scaffolding). So much of my professional and personal digital identity is now wrapped up in this particular brand that it seems unnatural to me to try and separate myself from it. Readywriting is such a large life bit for me, it should be considered a life chunk. A chunk so large that it makes sense for me to built my domain around it.  ### Add comment Cancel reply  Comment  Name   Email   Website  Notify me of new posts by email.

Of those, 3000 have been reported as active in their Client Area over the last month. I'm sure there is some slippage in the 10,000 number, and not all of them are still customers. But it does point to the fact that over the last two and a half years there has been an a groundswell of interest in Reclaim Hosting services beyond our wildest dreams ? well, except the one involving handcuffs and Drano.  Anyway, what Tim and I imagined as a niche interest in other schools running Domain of One's Own pilots quickly unearthed the fact that just about everyone in educational institutions from IT to libraries to academic departments to individual courses were looking to host off-campus. And while most folks turn to the big hosts initially, it quickly becomes apparent that nobody can support students and educators using open source web applications like Reclaim Hosting. #NOBODY!!! We know what you need before you do [said while waving arms creepily, yet gracefully].  But the aggregate is just that, and numbers can quickly become a telescopic hammer that only provide vague outlines of what's happening. So let's get microscopic and look at just one. Yesterday I got a question from Anna E. Kijas, Senior Digital Scholarship Librarian at Boston College Libraries, regarding some thumbnails that weren't working on her Omeka install. Turns out the path on the server to the ImageMagick library Omeka requires was off, preventing the resizing and generation of thumbnails for images. We got that fixed, and the site was back to its original glory.  Documenting Teresa  Out of curiosity I looked around Anna's site, discovering the open access scholarly research site Documenting Teresa CarreÐo, dedicated to the nineteenth-century Venezuelan pianist, singer, composer, and conductor Teresa CarreÐo. I was learning about this world renowned pianist for the first time, and I love how each item in the collection is based on a documented performance she gave between 1862 and 1917. Here's a random entry featuring a write-up from the The Evening World about her performance at Carnegie Hall on December 8, 1916, noting she had ""maintained her power, her art, and her musicianship unimpaired.""  A perfect example of the web of sharing that I love supporting.

The answer was disappointing (no one, pretty much), and her solution was to bring a flash drive to interviews and ask potential employers if they would want to take a look. Well, I am not daft, and I know that no employer is going to spend any amount of my 20-30 minute interview time looking at my portfolio. So I decided to publish it on the web and add the web address to my resume. I think that a lot of education students feel the same way that I did: ""The portfolio is a waste of time!"" But it doesn't have to be.

I plan on regularly updating this page with more focused resources given this quick guide is focused specifically on customizing WordPress after taking you through the minute and a half it requires to get an account and install WordPress. Damn we are good!    Keep in mind that Reclaim Hosting is first and foremost a web hosting platform that allows students, staff, and faculty to build their digital presence online. In this regard it is by no means limited to portfolios, you can use it to create anything from course hubs to research sites to personal blogs and much more. At the same time, it provides several applications commonly used for portfolios in higher education, such as WordPress, Omeka, and Mahara to name just a few. What you get in a portfolio from Reclaim Hosting versus specific portfolio tools like Digication, Chalk & Wire, etc., is choice and possibility. You are not limited to a specific, proprietary system; you can customize your portfolio with thousands of freely available themes and plugins; and, finally, you have access to software that is popular, portable, and affordable.  In order to get a sense of how Reclaim Hosting could provide a portfolio solution for your university, we have created State University. StateU provides the opportunity to experience how getting access to a domain and web hosting would work at your school.  ### Signing-Up at StateU  The following video will demonstrate how easy it is to get up and running with a domain and web hosting on StateU.  Once you have an account on StateU, you'll see your control panel dashboard, which will look like this:  There are several features in the control panel, and if you want to get a sense of how all of the different bits work you can see a comprehensive overview here.  ### Installing WordPress  For the purposes of this quick resource guide, we are going to highlight WordPress given it powers 25% of all sites on the web Let's say that again, but this time with feeling, ""25% OF ALL WEBSITES on the INTERNET!"" The 50 second video below provides a quick walk-through of how to install WordPress, and there is also documentation for installing WordPress if the video is not cutting it.  ### Adding WordPress Themes  A benefit of installing and managing your own WordPress site as a portfolio is the freedom you have to install and customize any theme you'd like. And adding them couldn't be easier. From your WordPress dashboard click Appearance > Themes to view the themes you currently have installed. You can have several different themes installed at the same time and switch between them. Clicking Add New will allow you to search and browse the thousands of themes available in the WordPress directory. When you find one that you like go ahead and click Install to add it to your list. You can choose to activate that theme immediately, or you can go back and browse for more themes.  Perhaps you secured a theme from elsewhere on the web and you want to add it to your site. To upload a theme you'll still click Add New but then you'll click Upload Theme. Select the zip file containing the theme and it will begin uploading. Once it's done you can activate the theme and get started customizing it.  ### Installing and Activating WordPress Plugins  When building your WordPress-based portfolio you're not limited to the stock set of tools that come with the software, there's an entire ecosystem of plugins for you to take advantage of. What are plugins? Plugins for WordPress allow you to add functionality to your site that doesn't normally come in a standard install. Wanna have all the new posts get sent to Facebook or Twitter? There's a plugin for that. Wanna build a contact form? Well, there's a plugin for that.  Adding plugins is a snap. From your WordPress Dashboard go to the Plugins page where it lists all of the plugins you currently have installed as well as which ones are turned on. Clicking Add New will connect you with the WordPress Plugin Directory where you can search and browse from over 35,000 plugins to install and customize. Find the one you like and it's as simple as clicking Install andActivate and you're ready to start setting it up. Installing plugins from your computer is also easy, just go to Add New and click Upload Plugin to upload the plugin from your computer and install it.  ### Creating and Organizing Content  #### Posts vs. Pages  Out of the box, WordPress provides two primary content types for you two work with: Posts andPages. If you read blogs or have ever written for a blog before, the concept of a post is probably a bit familiar. Posts often are content that appear on your blog in some kind of scheduled way. They usually are presented on your site in reverse-chronological order. Posts might be what you use to share your regular thoughts, reflections, or ideas about a topic. Posts make up a kind of ""river"" of content that you're producing as part of your work flow. For a portfolio posts may be work-in-progress, reflections, focused research, etc. And they can be categorized to represent various threads of your work.  Pages usually correspond to more traditional concept of what makes up a Web site. Pages are presented outside of the flow of content that are posts. They are more likely to stand alone and be organized according to a traditional hierarchy using the Custom Menus feature in WordPress. Pages might be content less frequently updated. So, for your portfolio that could be the About page or a resume page.  Categories and tags (which are used in WordPress to help you organize your content) are ONLY available on posts. Page organization is done through customizing your site menu.  WordPress also creates Category Pages and Tag Pages that display all the posts in a category or tag. You can use these to provide topic pages on your site that automatically filter your posts based on a category or tag.  ### Using Custom Menus  Out of the box, most WordPress themes will create default navigation for your site based upon the content you create. Posts, for example, will be available through some kind of blog presentation  ?  displayed in reverse, chronological order. In addition, you may be able to add Widgets to your site's sidebar that allow readers to navigate your posts based upon the category they were in or when they were published.  Pages, by default, are usually used to build a menu somewhere in your theme. Each top-level page becomes another item in that menu. When you create new pages, you can choose to ""nest"" them underneath other pages by choosing a page Parent. This can be cumbersome, however, and, eventually, you may wish to organize your site's content by creating a Custom Menu.  In addition to allowing you to more flexibly organize the pages on your site, Custom Menus now allow you to add posts, categories/tags, and custom links to your menu. With this feature, you can really build an entirely customized navigation tool for your site, and you can be sure that all your content is organized and available to your readers exactly how you want.  There are two primary components to building a Custom Menu:    1. You must designated and organize the links you want to be in your menu.   2. You must ""place"" the menu somewhere in your theme. Most themes will have at least one Custom Menu built into their design. Some may have several areas designated for Custom Menus. Older themes may not use Custom Menus at all; for these you will have to rely on the default menus created by the them based on your site's content.  #### Building Your Custom Menu  Start at your site's Dashboard and choose Appearance > Menus.  In the Custom Menus interface that appears, type a name for your menu. This can be anything you want. It doesn't get displayed anywhere; it's used by WordPress to identify and place your menu. Once you've typed the name, click Create Menu.  You'll now be presented with a screen that includes a section titled Menu Settings. This is where you'll indicate where you want your menu to appear in your theme. The number of locations available depends entirely upon the theme you choose. In the example shown below, there are two areas available; we've chosen to place the menu in the Top primary menu area which we know corresponds to the header menu. You may need to experiment a bit in order to find out where your menu will appear in your theme. You can always change this location later by coming back here and clicking theManage Locations tab.  Now that you've set up your menu and assigned it to a location, you can begin to add links to it. On the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see what content is available to add. On the right-hand side of the screen, in the Menu Structure area, you can arrange and organize your links.  By default, you may not see everything that is available to you to add to your menu. For example, posts can be added to menus, but they're not usually displayed by default. To make more content available, click the Screen Options tab at the top of your WordPress screen, and then click off the check boxes that correspond to additional content.  To add content to your menu, simply check it off on the left, and click the Add to Menu button.  Your new content will appear on the right, and you can drag items in the order you want them to appear. Drag items to the right to indent them under other items. This will usually make them appear as drop-down items in your menu.  You can add custom links to your menu by clicking the Links section on the left. In the short form that appears, enter your link's URL, and a text for the link. Click Add to Menu to move it to the left.  Note that you can change the link text of any item you add to your menu. This can be helpful if you have a page with a long title, and you'd like the link to not take up so much space. You can abbreviate the title in the Navigation Label section, and that shorter text will become the actual menu link.  When you are done, make sure you click Save Menu.  #### Other Notes about Menus     When you add a Category or Tag to a menu, the link will take your readers to an archive of all the posts on your site that use that category or tag. This can be a very useful feature for organizing your content when you're using posts to share your work.    In addition to assigning Custom Menus to theme areas, there is a default Custom Menu widget that you can put in the sidebar of your site. This is useful for creating smaller, customized navigation for your site.    If you forget to click Save Menu after making changes to your menu location or content, you will lose your work!  ### Uploading and Embedding Media in WordPress  #### Uploading  You can upload files into your site's Media Gallery and then link to them in your posts/pages. This works very well for images, and when you take this approach for images you have the added benefit of being able to make use of WordPress' built-in editing tools. Also, when you upload images to WordPress, it automatically creates different sizes that you can use, as needed. This approach works less well for video. In order to have your media files actually show up in a ""player"" (with controls for stopping, pausing, etc.) you'll need to install a plugin. Otherwise, you'll only be able to include links to the files. How people view them will depend a bit on the setup on their own computer and in their own browser. They may, for example, have to download the media file and then open it in another program on their computer.  #### Embedding  You can embed media from other sites easily in WordPress, the above images and videos are perfect examples of this. Embedding an image just means providing a URL to it's location elsewhere on the Web. Instead of uploading it to the server, WordPress grabs that image from the external source and displays it on your post/page. However, with this approach you lose your editing capabilities as well as the resizing feature.  Embedding audio and video from external sources becomes easier with every version of WordPress it seems. These days, you can embed video and audio from many external services (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, complete list here) by simply placing the full URL of the audio/video location on it's own line in your post/page. There is a complete list of supported external services, and you can learn more about embedding from external sources at the WordPress site.  ### The End is the Beginning  This brief resource guide is focused on just one of many applications you have access to at Reclaim Hosting ? albeit by far the most popular. One of the things you will quickly realize about choosing na industry-standard web hosting solution for portfolios on your campus is that it is not a one-size-fits solution. Rather, it provides departments, faculty, and students alike a tool that they can customize to meet their particular needs. What's more, it foregrounds the act of engaging and thinking critically about how we architect and build spaces for and on the web. In that regard, it is very much a platform for both engagement and reflection that is student-centered and integrated more generally with the process of creating and reflecting that should be at the heart of an education-based portfolio.  "Lee Skallerup Bessette,Claiming a Domain of My Own: Overwhelmed by WordPress,http://umwdtlt.com/claiming-a-domain-of-my-own-overwhelmed-by-wordpress/,12/18/2015,"# Claiming a Domain of My Own: Overwhelmed by WordPress  December 18, 2015  |In Domain of One's Own  |By Lee Skallerup Bessette  In my last post, I explained the process of choosing my domain name. I thought that that would be the hardest part; I have used wordpress.com before in my teaching, and have even worked with faculty to develop their web presence. But I wasn't fully prepared for the sheer size and scope of the Domain of One's Own project, learning about the full potential and possibilities of the initiative. I am also terrible at choosing an appropriate theme.  These two challenges are not mutually exclusive; I have typically used ""the Internet"" as a platform for sharing text in various forms. I am a writer, I taught writing, and I came of age when the Internet was primarily good for sharing text (dial-up is really only good for that). And while I can creatively think of ways for others to feature their work on the web, or to think about having their students create multimodal assignments, I have a lot of trouble seeing how to do that for myself and my own work.  I see all of the potential of DoOO and think to myself, oh goodness, I'm not doing any of this. And when I look at the long list of potential themes, I think, these are all for people doing really cool multimedia things on the web, not for someone like me who focuses primarily on text.  I have said elsewhere that design and visuals are not my strong suit. Give me a good page filled with white spaces and black textƒand little else. I don't nerd out over fonts or color palates or even the placement of photoshop- perfected photographs. Make it look clean, make it easy to find things, focus on the text, and that's it.  But while that sounds easy, it really isn't, especially because the website I'm creating isn't going to be a blog, but more of a landing page. What text(s) do I want to highlight? If this is about bringing together the bits of myself scattered all over the internet, how will that work? What should it look like? What plugins should I be using? How should it all be organized?  What have I gotten myself into?  Thankfully, I work with a terrific team who have been very patient with me and myƒquirks. It's been fun to try and articulate my vision for the site while also remembering that it's 2015 and I can do interesting things on the Internet visually. I ended up choosing ""Independent Publisher"" and added a crumpled paper background, at the suggestion of Jesse. I think it really captures what I want to communicate with my site and the general ethos I want to convey.  Next up, deciding on a structure, adding content, and then playing with the CSS to really make it mine.

"Jim Groom,Domains as Ground Zero for the Struggle over Agency,http://bavatuesdays.com/domains-as-ground-zero-for-the-struggle-of-agency/,12/21/2015,"BYU's Bold Plan to Give Students Control of Their Data  I was really pleased with Marguerite McNealïs article in edSurge on Brigham Young University's Personal API experiment. It can be hard to explain (at least for me), but she does an excellent job providing an accessible frame for the project by looking at it in terms of students finally being able to manage and control their own data. I think the following paragraph summarizes the idea behind a personal API as clearly as anything else I've seen:  > A personal API builds on the domain concept ? students store information on their site, whether it's class assignments, financial aid information or personal blogs, and then decide how they want to share that data with other applications and services. The idea is to give students autonomy in how they develop and manage their digital identities at the university and well into their professional lives  The idea of autonomy in relationship to our personal data puts the discussion in a far broader context, and its immediacy is anything but academic. That said, I think it's telling that a number of universities have been pushing hard to bring the importance of controlling your data to their academic communities. BYU's work around the personal API is a really exciting early attempt at what this might look like. I could listen all day to Phil Windley talk about what he calls ""sovereign source identity,"" an idea he credits to fellow Long Islander and <del>UMW grad</del> (we met at UMW though) Devon Loffreto:  > ""We want to teach students that this isn't the only way identity happens online. They can create their own,"" Windley says. This fall BYU introduced its Domain of One's Own pilot to 1,000 student and faculty participants. But offering personal Web spaces is just the beginning, Windley says. ""Domains help students understand their personal identity. The next step is understanding your personal data and how you control that.""  Absolutely right! And Adam Croom ? who has been going gang busters with University of Oklahoma's Domain of One's Own project OU Create ? frames this argument along the lines of a negotiation that should be taking place but isn't:  > ""It's the idea that tapping into one's data should be a negotiation that the student gets to make,"" says Adam Croom, director of digital learning at the Center for Teaching Excellence at the University of Oklahoma (OU). ""Why can't I manage what apps tap into my data, whether that's the learning management system or the bursar's office? Why aren't there terms and conditions for students to understand who has access to their data?""  Another article I found alongside this one, thanks to the Cassandra of Ed- Tech, was the article in Education Week proclaiming 2016 will be ""The Year of Agency."" If that's right ? and I hope it is ? that means more an more universities will need to start rethinking their infrastructure, and APIs have helped BYU and University of Oklahoma do just that. And so much of that work has been make possible thanks to the tireless evangelism of Kin Lane who has provided a vision of what APIs can be for Higher Ed. One we desperately needed.  At the same time, giving students, faculty, and staff more control over their data will not be without some serious struggle. A response to this article published today on EducationDive illustrates why giving students control over their data might be an issue for some:  > Schools are tracking student movements around campuses, incorporating data about how many times they visit the library or the tutoring center into performance data, merging that with student information system and learning management system data, and then developing predictive models to help counselors and students themselves. Giving students access to their own data is one thing, but letting them block others from seeing it is a different beast that could derail retention efforts.  Derailing retention? It's strange to see the idea of allowing students to decide who gets to see their data, for how long, and why as somehow antithetical to keeping them? There is a joke in there somewhere. Fact is, the realities behind the learning analytics applications that have been relentlessly tracking student's personal data may very soon be coming to a head. I would bet there has been little to no transparency about what student data universities are tracking, and whom they are sharing it with. Hell, I'm sure a number of universities aren't even aware themselves of what data these third party applications are collecting. The idea that someone empowering students to opt-out of these unilateral relationships with various technology vendors is somehow preventing them from doing their job is demonstrative of just how much of the job of teaching and learning they're offshoring to third- party technology solutions. And I won't even get into the insane idea that tracking a student's movement around campus is a sound academic counseling strategy.  Reclaim Hosting was born out of a movement that is grounded in the principle of empowering students and faculty to take control of their teaching and learning. And as Phil Windley notes, understanding who has access to their data and how it is being used will be ground zero for that struggle if we are, indeed, entering the year of agency.    I found this article thanks to the all-knowing, all-seeing Audrey Watters, who linked to it in this week's Newsletter. You'd think given I was quoted in this I might know about it, but Audrey actually reads the web ? all of it ? unlike me ??  "Jim Groom,Personal APIs and Academic Libraries,http://bavatuesdays.com/personal-apis-and-academic-libraries/,1/4/2016,"Roger Schonfeld's ""Improving Privacy by Rethinking Architecture"" post on The Scholarly Kitchen blog does an excellent job of exploring the question of privacy and third-party data collection for researchers and academic libraries:  > By having comparatively little user activity data on their own hands, and fragmenting those data they do keep, libraries may feel they have sidestepped an ethical dilemma [researching anonymously]. But they surely have missed the opportunity to build the personalized discovery and research information management tools that scientists and other academics need. In doing so, libraries have underserved researchers and other users, putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to other providers. But at the same time, they have not placed limits on the data gathering and usage of content providers and other vendors nearly as strictly as they often claim for themselves.  It's a tricky issue, and Schonfeld adriotly underscores the irony of outsourcing research services as a means of exonerating your library, while at the same time forcing the community you serve into much more precarious conditions. And while steps need to be taken to manage the sharing of data with these third-party services, the deeper issue he gets at is that our thinking assumes the current state of IT infrastructure. What if that infrastructure was designed in such a way that academics had control over the data they shared while doing their research. Not only as a means of privacy protection ? though definitely that ? but also as a means to extend such a ""decentralized architecture"" to serve as individualized research archives (a personal cyberinfrastructure).  I was excited Schonfeld highlighted the Personal API project Reclaim Hosting is working on with Brigham Young University presently, and I really liked the way in which he extrapolates the vision of providing students more control over their data to researchers controlling access to their own scholarly work, and changing some of the basic ways we understand sharing and publishing one's work.  > If successful, it is possible to imagine such a decentralized architecture being extended to serve the needs of a researcher account in terms of library resources and content platforms. Indeed, I have argued that a cross-platform user account controlled by the researchers themselves would bring vast improvements in the processes of authorizing access to an appropriate copy of an information resource, while dramatically improving one's control of one's own data. Such an architecture represents a sea-change compared with today's systems and it is no small thing to imagine the costs and logistical complexities of a transition.  The logical and political complexities of such a transition are no small thing to say the least. And while organizations like BYU that have visionary folks like Kelly Flanagan and Phil Windley leading the charge are rare, Schonfeld's final note suggests quite hopefully that alternatives are both possible and important:  > Even so, the work that Reclaim Hosting and BYU are undertaking is more than just experimental. It suggests that, when the political and organizational stars align, an entirely different architecture for the control of user data is possible.  That is so awesome, and why not? The time has come, and I know for certain that numerous other institutions are keen on what the folks at BYU are doing, and are prepared to double down on giving people more power over the online identities, personal data, and digital domains. Reclaim is in the air!  "Jim Groom,Six Years of Stats on UMW Blogs,http://bavatuesdays.com/six-years-of-stats-on-umw-blogs/,1/11/2016,"Today is the first time in ten years I will not be beginning a semester at UMW  ? and that number is 20 years if you count CUNY and UCLA. I've spent a long, long time in higher ed, and I've always been a fan of the beginning of the semester, seemed to be filled with so much promise and possibility. That said, I am enjoying the fact that on day one of Spring semester at Reclaim Hosting I am entirely caught up and my plate is clear. A great way to start the year, even if it cannot last.  One of the projects Reclaim Hosting has taken on over the last few months is migrating and hosting Virginia Commonwealth University's WordPress Multisite install Rampages. The site is one of the biggest multisite installs running at a university I know of, with more than 12,000 users and almost as many sites ? it's massive. What's more, it has grown at an exponential rate over the last two years, and it shows no signs of slowing. Tim has led the charge migrating and customizing this install to deal with the resource demands of scaling such a site. I hope we can provide a more detailed explanation of how he set it up, but it's still being tweaked and balanced for performance, so we (royal for Tim) will have our hands full with that early this semester.  While trying to gauge the setup and the demands on such a system, I was looking through some of the historical traffic we got on UMW Blogs over the last six years, and once I got into it I couldn't help myself. I've been pretty good about letting the work I've done at UMW go. In fact, it was fairly easy given the group I worked with is entirely gone now. But one thing we theorized about in 2013 and 2014 was the idea that UMW Blogs role would wane with the advent of UMW Domains. It makes sense, right? The more folks you have getting their own web hosting and domains, the less that need a blogging platform like UMW Blogs. So, given I have the historical data for UMW Blogs in Google Analytics, I ran a quick comparison year over year from 2010 through 2015 measuring the number of sessions, users, and pageviews for each year to test this theory.  Update: Previous graph was had sessions and users mislabeled, that is now fixed.  Turns out that the year we started Domain of One's Own was the biggest year for pageviews on UMW Blogs historically. And while there was a slight dip in 2014 for users and sessions (with a bigger decline in pageviews), that was not true in 2015. In fact, the number of sessions and users were both the highest on record, and the number of pageviews was up by more than 260K.  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  Sessions  1,026,145  1,529,364  2,024,241  2,338,962  2,027,602  2,284,683  Users  653,938  1,048,703  1,490,398  1,812,565  1,659,803  1,876,137  Pageviews  2,527,780  3,414,883  4,266,295  4,218,162  3,241,595  3,484,666  So, there goes the theory that UMW Domains would cut significantly into the usage of UMW Blogs. It may not have grown as much as it did from 2010-2013, but it has not declined significantly either. Interesting. One of the things it points to right away is that there seems to be more than enough demand for both. I have no idea what the future will bring to this system, and I am officially off the case. Nonetheless, the numbers provide one testament to this platform that for more than 8 years has proved to be a remarkable open resource. And if we look at just the last 6 years it has served for almost 9 million users who had more than 11 million sessions resulting in 20+ million pageviews. That's a lot of fish.    Sessions includes repeating visitors from the same IP, whereas users is a distinct user.  "Jim Groom,Coffee and #ds106 at FredXchange,http://bavatuesdays.com/coffee-and-ds106-at-fredxchange/,1/16/2016,"I am back in Fredericksburg for a few days for some business and house cleaning. I head up to NYC on Tuesday, so it will be a fairly quick turn here, but it's always exhilarating to spend some quality time with my pardner Tim Owens. Yesterday was particularly eventful because we we're invited to talk at an Open Coffee Event hosted at the Foundry, the new co-working space in Fredericksburg brought to you by the good people of the FredXchange.  The story of how this came about is another bizarre testament to the wonder of the web. Libby O'Malley, one of the movers and shakers behind FredXchange, emailed me out of the blue a few weeks back asking me if I wanted to talk with the folks at the FredXchange about the venerable and righteously right ds106. She informed me that she had found out about that international gem through doing a google search for ""Digital Marketing Degree,"" and ds106 was mentioned as a free alternative in an article that was a top-hit . I think it may have been this article, but I'm not sure. Look ma, no SEO!!!  Crazy, I told her I am in Italy living like a pimp daddy in the old country, to which she suggested I come in via Google Chat. As much as I love the internet, I hate remote presentations. They can be done well, but the amount of work it takes to create the conditions of a good remote presentation versus simply being there is staggering. That said, I did know I would be in Freddy for a few days and threw that out and she agreed. I'm glad she did.  I have been in repose in my mountain villa in Italy mustering as much thought leader mojo as possible. It's hard work, and I don't recommend it for the faint of heart. Being a visionary is extremely demanding, especially in a country that is steeped in the hairy legacy of Lucio Battisti. But ed-tech pioneers persevere, and I knew it was time to get back on the road after 3 months of intensive meditation. And what did I do? I got nostalgic about the past ? but I blame that on my new surroundings.  More seriously, I hadn't presented for a few months, which is a good while for me. It felt good to talk about ds106. It just never gets old, and once I get going I feel as passionate about it as I did in 2011. It was pure in my heart. Tim and I didn't have a presentation prepared, or even a plan really. We talked briefly about an outline on the car ride over. Early days of the Bluehost experiment at UMW -> UMW Blogs -> ds106 -> Domain of One's Own -> Reclaim Hosting. It's interesting to look at that narrative progression and to see ds106 at the center of the story. I think that's pretty accurate. ds106 galvanized a community, brought Tim and I into contact, and reaffirmed that the Domain of One's Own experiment wasn't all that crazy at scale. I took the first 10-15 minutes talking about the Blue Host Experiment, UMW Blogs, and the beginnings of ds106, and Tim took the last 10-15 minutes talking ds106, Domain of One's Own, and Reclaim Hosting.  It was quite fun, and I really enjoyed being back in front of a group of people talking about this stuff with Tim. One of the things about my work with Tim that is so rewarding is that we truly do have an amazing partnership. We agree on the fundamental principles undergirding Reclaim Hosting: fierce independence and freedom online! What's more, we push each other to keep going further. Tim has an insane standard for the quality of work and support that defines Reclaim, and every day I wake up knowing that it is the goal. When people come to Reclaim they get the best ed-tech support anywhere. Period. I stand by that statement. Try me, I dare you.  It was awesome to be back in Fredericksburg hanging with Tim Owens sharing the work we've done thus far and planning for what's to come. In short, taking care of dot.bizness.  "windley,Aspen Grove Winter Workshop 2016,http://byuocio.tumblr.com/post/137583594259/aspen-grove-winter-workshop-2016,1/18/2016,"The Aspen Grove Winter Workshop (AGWW) will be held February 17 and 18, 2016 at BYU's Aspen Grove Conference Center. The workshop is hosted by BYU's Office of the CIO. You can get tickets on Eventbrite. The workshop is open to anyone.  AGWW is an unconference that is focused on University APIs, Domain of One's Own, Personal Learning Systems, Learning Management Systems, Student Information Systems, and other strategic uses of IT in the university environment. This isn't just a technical conference. There will be plenty of discussions about the impact of these technologies on learning and the modern university.  We held the first edition of this workshop last June. Jim Groom did a good job summarizing the extraordinary two days. He says:  > The conference was relaxed, intimate, and intense all at once ? is that possible? There were only 40 people, but we had 33 sessions over two days. We got to know each other fairly well, and spent a lot of time thinking and talking about APIs, but in a low-key environment. Major props to Heidi Nobantu Saul for framing and facilitating the unconference approach beautifully. It reminded me of the 2007 Northern Voice Moose Camp, just with fewer people. A lot of serendipitous discussions, in-betweeness, and conversational sessions.  We loved how the workshop turned out last June, so we decided to do it again. There was a lot of energy and many, many great sessions.  As an unconference, AGWW has no assigned speakers or panels, so it's about getting stuff done. If you come and there weren't any sessions that interested you, that's your own fault since you can pretty much call any session you like. We will have a trained open space facilitator at the workshop to run the show and make sure everything goes smoothly.  We'll be up in the mountains above Sundance Ski Resort, so come for the workshop and stay for the skiing! We've reserved a block of rooms at Sundance and will be providing a shuttle between Sundance and Aspen Grove. There's also plenty of hotel space down in the valley.  The workshop should be a lot of fun. I hope you can make it! Sign up now!  "Jeremy Dean,An Annotated Domain of One's Own,http://jeremydean.org/blog/getting-started/an-annotated-domain-of-ones-own/,1/27/2016,"## A Domain of One's Own  Yesterday, I crossed off one of my 2016 New Year's Resolutions in a single afternoon: ""Register my own domain."" I registered ""jeremydean.org"" and installed WordPress at jeremydean.org/blog, where you are likely reading this post. I even started a little experiment with Scalar, the book publishing platform out of USC, which I'll discuss in a future entry. It's nothing pretty to look at yet  ?  it's only January, after all! But it's a start and I want to talk about that start here, why I wanted to do this and why it might be useful/interesting to others.  I'm late to the party here as I have been with lots of neat tech things over the years (iPods, iPhones, Facebook, Harry Potter). This is of course how the early bloggers did it, and for several years now there's been a kind of reclamation movement around that lost infrastructure and philosophy. Many of us (and I genuinely include myself here) are happy posting our thoughts online through systems owned and managed by others, mostly for-profit companies who retain rights to our cultural production and make it very difficult for us do anything else with that content besides share it within their platforms.  This blog is addressed more to those like me that may not have thought fully about this stuff or acted upon it, rather than to any old school open web activists who might happen here. I think there's a larger group of folks that would align with the politics of the open web if it were a little more fully and simply articulated. I like to think of having a domain of one's own as the backyard gardening  ?  or better, the community gardening  ?  of the Web. If you like the idea of growing your own vegetables or owning your own chickens, then I think you might also like owning and cultivating your own domain.  One major strand of that larger reclamation movement has been led by Jim Groom and Tim Owens, who started a project called ""A Domain of One's Own"" when both were at the University of Mary Washington Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies. Probably the best single piece written on the work that I've found is Audrey Watters' ""Beneath the CobblestonesƒA Domain of One's Own."" Here's how she sums up the significance of the project, since expanded to other universities:  > The Domain of One's Own initiative prompts us to not just own our own domain  ?  our own space on the Web ? but to consider how we might need to reclaim bits and pieces that have already been extracted from us.  >  > It prompts us think critically about what our digital identity looks like, who controls it, who owns our data, who tracks it, who's making money from it. It equips us to ask questions  ?  technical questions and philosophical questions and economic questions and political questions about and for ourselves, our communities, our practices  ?  knowing that we have a stake as actors and not just as objects of technology, as actors and not just objects of education technology.  Basically the original idea was to help students and faculty register their own domains in the interest of giving them more control over their online identities, or as Gardner Campbell calls it, their ""personal cyberinfrastructure."" It's a valuable exercise in web literacy  ?  again, the digital equivalent of learning to garden with all the attendant knowledges necessary to do so, about seasons, soil, etc. But it's also a political statement about how our content is managed online  ?  whether by us, according to our rules, or based on the terms of service of proprietary platforms, whether we sign up for them willingly ourselves or are forced to because of where we go to school, teach, or work.  I won't be adding much to the ongoing and important conversation happening about ""Domain of One's Own"" or broader issues around the politics of the open web except to make two simple points  ?  again, mostly for folks new to this stuff.  One, it's super easy and super cheap!  And two, not only can you blog and host content at this new site you own, but you can annotate that stuff as well using hypothes.is. Which is to say that you can own your own Medium.com  ?  a slick blog with some badass interactive functionality. (And if it's exposure you are going for you can easily syndicate your blog to Medium, which I've done here.)  Indeed, the reason why I decided to dive into this little experiment yesterday was because Gardner Campbell Tweeted a link to a Dave Winer blog:  > Anywhere but Medium https://t.co/sW2mJhLA7m > a trenchant critique-sums up some of my own misgivings. Why the rush to someone else's domain?  >  >  ?  Gardner Campbell (@GardnerCampbell) January 25, 2016  To which I replied:  > Not to mention your own domain can have much the same functionality (social annotation) as Medium with @hypothesis https://t.co/npbGz4giWK  >  >  ?  Dr. Dean (@drjdean) January 26, 2016  And then I figured I had to actually do it.  ## How To  So, here's how easy it is to get set up with your own locally hosted WordPress blog with the hypothes.is plugin activated:  Go to Reclaim Hosting  ?  Jim and Tim's start-upy spin off of their UMW work with A Domain of One's Own  ?  specifically go here, to their shared hosting services. Sign up for a personal plan for $25 a year.  You can install WordPress easily using the Installatron  ?  great name, right? It's pretty clear that these Reclaim guys are deep into cultivating web literacy in a real way when they offer a simple definition like this for ""web application"" to help a humble school teacher like myself navigate this brave new world:  WordPress is right there under Content Management apps:  I'm not going to walk through the whole process of getting set up with WordPress, but I'll just say that, it didn't take me very long to have a live front page at jeremydean.org/blog to which I could add a cool picture. Mostly you just click through the installer in Reclaim and then once installed you go to the admin portal for your WordPress install and you're in WP:  I had some experience using WordPress, so it wasn't hard to put up my first post, but WP makes it real easy for you to get started, presenting you with a cute little mock-up post that you can then edit. And here's one of their tutorials on publishing a post just in case you can't figure it out yourself:  ## An Annotated Domain of One's Own  I will, though, briefly show how easy it is to add hypothes.is to a WordPress install like the one I describe setting up above. You can find the hypothes.is plugin by searching under ""Plugins"" in the WP admin dashboard menu. Click through to install and activate it. Then you need to go to Settings > Hypothesis and configure hypothes.is to appear where you want it to  ?  everywhere in the blog or only on certain posts or pages (identified by the ID number shown in the URL when editing the post or page). I choose to activate hypothes.is on all my blog posts for now  ?  and I also disabled page-bottom comments, because they're so 2006:  So then I wrote a brief microblog as my first post and annotated it using hypothes.is in the tradition of authors far far better than I playing with annotation not as the margin but as the center of a text, as J.G. Ballard does in his ""Notes Toward a Mental Breakdown.""  Outside of taking control my own online identity and cyberinfrastructure, a major reason for this experiment has been to think through with my hands, as director of education at hypothes.is, how an educator can make use of this combination of technologies for their classroom.  While hypothes.is allows you to collaboratively or individually annotate any page on the Web, sometimes teachers like to have their course content in one place. And sometimes the content they want students to annotate isn't already online somewhere and they need to host it themselves. A WordPress install is a great solution to both problems, not to mention issues around privacy (though hypothes.is has a groups functionality for that too). And with hypothes.is embedded in WordPress, then teachers don't have to guide students through installing and activating the hypothes.is browser extension or bookmarklet, because maybe they know what a browser extension is, but bookmarklet?!  An inspiration for me here is Larry Hanley, a professor at San Francisco State who showed up unsolicited in the hypothes.is content stream early last semester with students annotating a very cool WordPress site for his American lit course that had the app natively embedded thanks to our WP plugin  ?  he was even using RSS to generate a feed of annotations by his students at the site. Larry calls Ralph Waldo Emerson ""the original Edupunk"" for his idea of ""creative reading,"" which Larry believes has found a 21st century manifestation in collaborative annotation. (Below Larry talks about his experiences using hypothes.is in the English classroom.)  I hadn't done what Larry did with WordPress + hypothes.is until yesterday, but now I can show other teachers how to leverage these technologies, cheaply (possibly even freely) and easily, in order to create their own annotated and/or annotatable anthologies or course readers.  With the hypothes.is plugin installed on my WordPress blog, it feels a lot like Medium. When a reader selects text, they are given the option to make a note or highlight. The note can be public or private. Unlike on Medium, I as author don't have curatorial control over what annotations get published. You can annotate my blog whether I like it or not using hypothes.is. While the Medium authorial feature makes a lot of sense, it also works against the more open, decentralized concept of the Web in which individual self expression is not censored by content producers and distributors.  Highlighting and note-taking with hypothes.is Highlighting and note-taking options on Medium  It made my 2015 when Audrey Watters included hypothes.is in her year end round up of ""Top Ed-Tech Trends,"" which positioned Jim and Tim's work with A Domain of One's Own at the center of an ""indie ed-tech"" movement. We have some work to do to fully develop it, but I believe hypothes.is is thinking about and working with users and infrastructure in the right way so as to empower annotators to own and manage their content however they so choose. It made my 2016?I know, I'm already having quite a year?when Adam Croom, Director of Digital Learning at University of Oklahoma, and another inspiration here, started shipping WordPress installs with the hypothes.is plugin in the OU institution of Domain of One's Own. Personally and professionally, I will continue to aspire and conspire to be a part of this movement in ed-tech and on the web more broadly.  Note: I want to just quickly add that at some point I tried to get a little fancy and change the URL for my WP blog and messed something up, getting a 500 error. I reached out to support at Reclaim and Tim Owens responded almost immediately, helping me move my stuff over. They may be even faster on the draw there than the good folks at education@hypothes.is.       Also published on Medium.

In particular, their initiative designed to provide British Columbia's post-secondary institutions the means to easily install and explore a range of open source applications using Sandstorm.io. What's nice about Sandstorm is it provides access to a number of open source applications that don't run on a commodity hosting LAMP stack, such as the blogging software Ghost, the collaborative text editor Etherpad, computational environments like the iPython Notebook, and Git Hosting with GitLab. And that's just a few of the over 50 applications Sandstorm supports out of the box, and if you you have an application you want to add that's also possible.  Sandtorm.io's App Market  What struck me on this run through Sandstorm (Tim turned me onto it over a year ago) was the application market. It contains a number of applications folks have asked us about hosting through Reclaim. Georgetown University was interested in the possibility of hosting iPython Notebooks on their dedicated Reclaim server, and the great Tony Hirst as been exploring how to host them for a while now. More recently, Shawn Graham at Carleton University was asking me about the possibility of hosting GitLab, which was new to me, and lo and behold that is a featured app on Sandstorm.  > hey @ReclaimHosting what would it take to set up something like Gitlab https://t.co/n4bGQmGTwr on one's own domain?  >  >  ?  Shawn Graham (@electricarchaeo) January 28, 2016  So, when the outlaw Tommy Woodward asked if Reclaim Hosting could spin-up a Sandstorm server for VCU's ALT Lab, I jumped at the chance. I have to hand it to the folks at Sandstorm, they made the process of setting up your own server dead simple. I'll document my process below, but their documentation is pretty awesome.  Setting up your server Sandstorm Server  So I wanted to experiment with the self-hosted version of Sandstorm.io, but they do provide managed hosting as well if you don't want to run your own server. In their Easy install instructions they give you details about what kind of server you should provision.  > ƒyou need a 64-bit Linux server connected to the Internet. (Requirements: Linux 3.13 or newer running on x86-64. 1GB+ of RAM; 2GB+ recommended.)  Knowing the details I headed over to Linode, one of our favorite cloud providers at Reclaim, and spun up an Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit virtual machine as per their recommendation. I'm telling you, spinning up servers in this brave new world of virtual hosting environments is freaking awesome. I added the smallest machine they have to start with, which is $10 a month, which just happens to meet the bare minimums for Sandstorm. Once I get a better sense of what VCU needs I can easily scale the server up.  If you are using Linode, once you login and create an account you will see a link in your dashboard to Add a Linode. Once you click that it will give you the option to choose how big a server you want (I started with the $10/month option). Once Linode creates the server, you will need to click on the Deploy an Image link:  From there you chose the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS image, leave the deployment Disk space as is, and allocate 512 Mb for swap disk space. After that, create a secure root password for the server and hit the Deploy button.  Once that is deployed return to the main dashboard of the Linode server you have created and hit the Boot button to start running the server.  You should now have your own $10 a month Linode server with an Ubunto Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit virtual machine up and running. Crazy, right?  Finally, you are gonna need to find the IP address and root password (which you just created) under Remote Access so that you can log into the server via terminal and install Sandstorm. Note the tabs Resize and Clone in your server dashboard which allow you to quickly resize the server as well as clone it. I love all the cloud babies.  Installing Sandstorm.io on Your Server  Now that you have your server up and running it is time to install Sandstorm. They have made this really easy, and I will use a series of screenshots to take you through the process step-by-step.  Once you login through terminal using ssh root@youripaddress and authenticate with the proper password you will then need to add the following command to start installing Sandstorm:  curl https://install.sandstorm.io | bash  1  curl https://install.sandstorm.io | bash  Once you do this, you will be prompted which version of Sandstorm you want to install. Choose 1, full server with automatic setup.  Then you are prompted with the details of what they are about to do, assuring you of good server administration along the way ??  Then you choose the subdomain of sandcats.io you want to run your instance on. For example, I setup VCU's instance subdomain as altlab.sandcats.io. For the test instance I created for this documentation I used reclaim.  After that, provide an email for disaster recovery purposes.  Finally, you will be provided with a link (highlighted in blue below) that you will need to copy and paste to start setting up Sandstorm.  That's it, pretty easy. They certainly walk you through it quite cleanly, even if it is command line.     Setting up Sandstorm  Now it is time to setup Sandstorm, once you copy and paste the link they give you at the end of the installation process into a browser, you should see something like this:  There are two main pieces to configure, the Login methods and SMTP to send folks their invites. I enabled all three login methods, i.e. Google, Github, and email. With email there isn't much to configure, just click the box and you are set. For Google and Github there are a few more steps, but Sandstorm walks you through them seamlessly. You are basically enabling OAuth through these apps, which assumes your users have accounts on them already. If not, then the email route is the way to go. Here is a screenshot of the configuration details for Google that Sandstorm supplies, pretty straightforward:  It's roughly the same for Github, just a tab bit easier.  Now, in order for any of that to work, you have to configure a SMTP relay server. This might seem alien, but it's not that bad. We use Mandrill at Reclaim, and I just logged in and created an API key for the Sandstorm instance and used our SMTP settings. It looks something like this:  smtp://user:pass@host:port  1  smtp://user:pass@host:port  And if your username has an @ in it you need to convert it to %40.  After that, you should send yourself an invite, and once you accept and login using that invite you will automatically become the admin. First person registered is Admin by default.  And that's it, with these steps you'll have your Sandstorm instance up and running. I'll follow-up on this post with some details about running applications, enabling application email, mapping domains, etc. But for now this post is long enough, and this covers the three steps to actually getting your Sandstorm server running.  Update: I followed up on this post with ""Anatomy of an Application in Sandstorm.""  "Jim Groom,Reclaim Your Hypothesis,http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-your-hypothesis/,2/3/2016,"I wanted to point folks to Jeremy Dean's excellent post ""An Annotated Domain of One's Own"" that details getting up and running with the web annotation tool Hypothesis on a self-hosted WordPress site. Now I'll admit it, it didn't hurt that Jeremy highlighted the awesomeness of Reclaim Hosting in his post, but regardless of that he provides an excellent conceptual framing of why managing your own domain is important as well as hands-on, practical how-to for getting up and running with Hypothesis using WordPress.  Additionally, I have to hand it to the folks at Hypothesis. I've been really impressed with the folks that work(ed) there. Last March at the IndieWebCamp in Cambridge I met Benjamin Young, who was in a prolonged conversation with Sir Tim Berners-Lee about some spec I have no idea about. Super smart person, and when we had dinner later that night totally down-to-earth and awesome. Looks like he since moved on to work for W3C, REST Fest, and the Apache Software Foundation, good for him ? that some open web stuff right there! Jeremy Dean's bio frames a long history in higher ed, and I love that he's out and about blogging his process, tweeting support, and generally getting folks excited about Hypothesis. What's more, when you're showcasing projects by faculty like Robin DeRosa and Larry Hanley, it's a good sign you are building your community from the ground up.  And then they went and hired one of my very favorite people who invented the internet: Jon Udell. It's no secret Udell's thinking has provided inspiration for so much of the work we did at UMW over the last decade, and it continues here at Reclaim Hosting. Bringing Udell on as Product Manager certainly reflects brilliantly on Hypothesis. What's more, I was really excited to see on Twitter the other day that Udell was speaking at BYU. Sending Udell on the road to talk about the open web, decentralization, and higher ed is boon for all of us!  So, if you judge an organization by it's people, then Hypothesis has been on a bit of a tear as of late.  "Anne Cong-Huyen,Environmental Science Students Build Website,http://diglibarts.whittier.edu/environmental-science-students-build-website/,2/5/2016,"This past fall, professor of Environmental Science Cinzia Fissore and the students of her ENST/INTD362 course, ""Resources-People- Innovations,"" engaged in a semester-long project aimed at developing a website using Whittier.Domains that described sustainability efforts at Whittier College. The project was partly funded by a DigLibArts grant to Prof. Cinzia Fissore.  Screenshot of image from http://sustainability.whittier.domains  Professor Fissore describes the project as follows:  ""The content of the website was the result of extensive research conducted by the students in various areas, namely landscaping, recycling, food production and composting, water use, and energy use. The final result is a living product that other groups, ideally faculty and their class, will use and implement to further explore the field of sustainability and use of resources in relation to various disciplines.  The project proved to be successful in that it exposed students to issues and challenges associated with implementing sustainability efforts at the local scale, such as Whittier College, and it was well integrated in the course material. Additionally, students acquired experience developing a website and learning about copyright and privacy, all of which represent a valuable transportable skill. Challenges were primarily related to the limited time available to undertake such an extensive work while dedicating time to other class material, but the students, with their enthusiasm and commitment, took ownership over the website and delivered an excellent product.""  One student described the course in this way:  ""Resources, People and Innovation was very educational in more than just the classroom setting. We were intitally split into groups and the students decided what the course would focus on (within the parameters of working towards campus sustainability.) Each group gathered different facts and figures about current campus conditions in water and energy usage, landscape, urban gardening and recylcing. We were given a lot of autonomy in how we went about gathering information and were given significant class time to bring forth any complications that arose. This course not only showed us how to gather information and make valid assessments for what could be done to improve current conditions but also gave us the backbone of how to make a website appealing with the fundamentals of WordPress. Professor Fissore was a remarkable teacher because she allowed the students to teach each other. Overall, I would highly recommend the course and professor to students.""

"Jim Groom,Small Systems Integration,http://bavatuesdays.com/small-systems-integration/,2/10/2016,"I'm not sure exactly what I mean by this. In fact, that very idea has me excited as a move towards see more small things happen. Small things is a theme I will be exploring this Spring, it resulted from a great discussion with the organizers of the AMICAL conference this year in Rome I'll be speaking at. The focus will be on small things, a sense of post-MOOC taking stock of the valence of terms like massive/local, big/small (data), and corporate/indie, the shape of the talk is not entirely clear to me though but I am taking Calvin Johnson's advice and exploring E.F. Schumacherïs book Small is Beautiful which posits the idea of Appropriate Technology. I'm excited by this talk, and I still have months to prepare. It really make s a huge difference when conference organizers take an hour of their time and talk to you about their community, their needs, and the general sense of focus and interest. I'm absolutely certain this talk will be the better for it.  And while the idea of small is bouncing around in my mind Tim Owens and I get on call with Jon Udell. One of the things he is thinking through right now is small systems integration. In particular as product manager for Hypothesis, how did Reclaim integrate web hosting into a universities identity management systems. Fact is, our work with providing universities a seamless, integrated service for web hosting on their campus is pretty awesome. We integrate with several authentication systems used at various universities: CAS, Shibboleth, Active Directory, LDAP, and we joined InCommon, a federated ID management consortium through Internet2, to make the Shibboleth that much more seamless.  How do we do it? Well, mostly through WordPress plugins. We wrap CPanel web hosting in a WordPress instance that enables us to use existing plugins to negotiate their various authentication systems. We still need to work with the campus IT and make sure we are getting only the user attributes they want us to have and we can then hand off that user to CPanel as an iframe in a WordPress page to provide a small, seamlesss integration of web hosting for a campus through single sign-on. However we feel about the push for single sign- on, it certainly makes provisioning and setting up web hosting around campus 1000x simpler, and that matters a ton. We've been having more and more schools use InCommon to integrate their Domain of One's Own web hosting package. Once it's up and working, it is beautiful. That said, Shibboleth is a complex beast and Tim has been digging in the last couple of months, and while listening to him talk to Udell yesterday about how Hypothesis might be able to provide schools like Oklahoma, BYU, Davidson, Emory, etc. might provide a more seamless, integrated solution for a campus to use their service for annotating across sites, LMS, courses, etc. is powerful is you are thinking about a campus tool available as a SPLOT. a simply tool for annotation you install through a WordPress container with pre-configured plugins integrated back to Hypothesis would be such small, simple, and useful edtech tool.  I realized these small system integrations that provide a user access to their work and federated across several services that ultimately feedback into a personal API is very much the trajectory of work the Domain of One's Own need to follow. How do we start seamlessly integrating in small, focused ways to build a wider federation of tools that help us manage and control the discovery and narrative of who we are on line and off. I have to keep this in focus, and the opportunity to hear Jon and Tim go, which was my point to begin with, reinforces for me we are doing just that. We are in full create mode at Reclaim now and key folks are starting to come together and get this work funded and working right, which in terms demonstrates the power of providing a campus community alternatives that need not be massive, expensive, or singular, it can be small, cheap, and decentralized. I like this path, it may not win widespread appeal, but that's all right, in fact it's kind of the point.  "Jim Groom,Changing Account Domains in WHM,http://bavatuesdays.com/changing-account-domains-in-whm/,2/12/2016,"Twice over the last two days I have gotten requests to change the domain of a web hosting account in cPanel. It's enough steps that it's not simple to tell someone how to do, and the fact is only server admins can do it. You need access to the Web Hosting Manager (WHM-the host of the hosts) interface to do it, so this tutorial is really for folks at various institutions (more than 30 now!) running their own Domain of One's Own package, as well as anyone who happens upon it. Welcome!  For the purposes of this tutorial you will need access to WHM (the management console for a cPanel web hosting server) and WHMCS (the client and billing management system that sits on top of cPanel).  You can make the below changes in WHM or WHMCS first, the order you choose to do it will not effect the outcome.  ### WHM  I start with WHM, once I am in there I use the quick search tool to find the List Accounts section. From there I click on List Accounts and search for my domain.  Once I search my domain the web hosting account I need to change the domain of will be filtered.  Next step is to click on the more options area (a + icon) to get the various options for modifying this account. The one I need to change the domain of the account is Modify Account.  From there I will be taken to a screen with many of the account's settings, including the first one: Primary Domain.  Change this field to the domain you want, in my case jimgroom.sites.grinnell.edu rather than jgroom.sites.grinnell.edu  After that change the changes, and be sure to select the ""Keep this account on package ïdefault'"" -even though it is not recommended-and click Proceed.  After that you should be all done in WHM. It is important to keep in mind that when you change the domain for the site applications you have installed in the hosting account may still need to be updated manually. This goes for everything from static HTML files to databases, changing the domain of the account WILL NOT change the domain in the links of files and databases for any applications installed.  ### WHMCS  That's all you have to do with WHM, and WHMCS is just as simple. You login and go to view/search clients and fine the account for the domain you want to modify.  Once you do you click on the number next to the name to view the client's account.  From there you want to click on the Products/Services tab in the client's account.  From there you will see the Domain field with the old domain.  Change this to the appropriate domain and click save.  After that, your account should have a new domain, and you may (or may not) need to make the appropriate changes in any applications currently running on your hosting account.  "Jim Groom,This is why we can't have nice things in Virginia EdTech,http://bavatuesdays.com/this-is-why-we-cant-have-nice-things-in-virginia-edtech/,2/19/2016,"During my time at OpenVA one of the things I really wanted to see happen was various institutions around the state working together to share technical infrastructure. How could we think about scaling something like Domain of One's Own for the VCCS? -or share that model with Virginia Tech or Northern Virginia Community College? Even beyond that, how could we rethink sharing machine images of various tools and applications these schools currently use to give all Virginia schools greater access to a diversity of educational technologies. A clearing house for educational technologies that might be inspired by and built on the model of something like AWS.  I moved on from OpenVA and UMW, but it was pretty clear this was never really going to come to fruition in Virginia for a few reasons:  1) Virginia is not a system, there is no way to organize something like this centrally beyond good will.  2) OpenVA was from the beginning a political committee, and it increasingly became more so. And while there's a lot of rhetoric about innovation and experimentation in politics, at the end of the day given a choice between supporting an experimental, multi-institution tech incubator and saving students money on free textbooks, the latter becomes a pretty easy choice. Particularly in a climate where tuition continues to rise due to lack of state funding.?  3) And if you are not saving students money, then your putting it in the pockets of corporations. There is a really bad precedent of the colossal waste possible when the state funds a collaborative tech initiative at universities in Virginia, it's called 4VA:  > The presidents of George Mason University, James Madison University, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University organized 4-VA in 2010. Each university contributed funding to establish the 4-VA Office and hire staff. Mr. John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems, Inc., supported the presidents' vision and sponsored a great deal of technology to seed the early projects. Virginia's legislature continues to provide project funding. In late 2014, Old Dominion University became the newest member of 4-VA.  So, four universities ? more recently a fifth in ODU?funded a series of CISCO video conferencing rooms at JMU, UVA, Virginia Tech, and GMU. This was Governor McDonald's vision (remember that crook?) of HE and the corporate world working together. CISCO provided the equipment, and universities paid for staff and upkeep of that equipment. In 2014-2015 the state funded 4VA at the tune of $3.6 million a year ? 60% of which went towards funding the infrastructure of the over-engineered video presence rooms at four of the biggest, wealthiest universities in the state.  2014-2015 Financial Statement for 4VA (click image for full 2014-015 executive report)  In terms of impact. Video conferencing? Really? The program switched up to start providing grants and course redesigns, but even that was crazy. 15 course redesigns in the 2014-2015 academic year at the tune of $500,000, or $33,000 for each course redesign ? those are almost MOOC-like costs ?? In short, 4VA was an brilliant example of how corporate and state collaborations ultimately become a drain on the taxpayer, and as much as $2 million in infrastructure costs squandered on technology you could reproduce well-enough with virtually free applications like Google Hangouts, Skype, or even appear.in. Hell, pay the couple of hundred dollars and get Zoom. This program has been funded since 2010, and at the 2014-2015 funding rate it would have cost the Virginia tax payers upwards of $20 million dollars. What's the return on investment? $2 million dollars in grants? Well, then you are only 18 million in the hole ?? What a joke.  This is why we can't have nice things in Virginia EdTech.  But I digress, this post was about that original vision of sharing actually useful infrastructure and technology tools across the Virginia colleges and universities, and it turns out our neighbors to the south, North Carolina's state university system, is trying something like this on for size. According to this article on Medium by Matthew Rascoff, the project lead for the University of North Carolina System, the UNC Learning Technology Commonsƒ  > ƒis a system-wide effort to curate an annotated catalogue of digital learning products available for accelerated purchase by the 20,000 faculty members of the UNC system, and to build a community of educators who share (anonymized, aggregated) learning outcomes and user experiences with those products.  So, vendors could go through what they promise is a painless process of applying to add their product to this catalogue of available tools, and have faculty write reviews and share uses of how they are using the tools. The platform this process happens in, Learning Trails, was compared to Trip Advisor for edtech technologies in this EDuSurge article ?effectively a technology purchasing commons for the North Carolina system. In fact, a tool to make the purchasing of edtech more seamless across the state, enabling the North Carolina University system to leverage their aggregate buying power to push down costs, which helps smaller campuses who may not have the numbers to negotiate a better deal. Dealing with UMW's purchasing when trying to build a Domain of One's Own was a lesson in how crazy that process can be, and streamlining that is more than welcome.  One of the small victories Tim and I had as we were walking out the door of UMW was to finally get a campus contract for UMW with Amazon's AWS, something the Virginia's Governor's office was interested in given they were exploring vehicles for purchasing AWS and were looking at our contract as vehicle for just that.? UNC Learning Technology Commons seems to be aiming to make that process more discoverable and streamlined, and that is pretty cool if they succeed. It would be nice if AWS was a service any school in North Carolina could access through such a system using a pre-negotiated rate and set of terms and conditions, which would enable the state of North Carolina to define more broadly the relationship they have with vendors around increasingly important questions like data privacy for students and faculty.  The idea of a marketplace for purchasing in edtech is not necessarily the sexiest idea when it comes to innovation and experimentation on the surface, but it could be a powerful mechanism for the faculty in the North Carolina system to create connections and share resources around the various tools they are using, as well as the why and how. What's more, it could provide simple ways to spin up new infrastructures, both big and small, across the state to provide a more heterogenous ecosystem for edtech options. Interesting stuff, I might just have to go and add Reclaim Hosting to the UNC Technology Learning Commons because North Carolina needs us more than they know!!!      1. It's hard to compete with cost saving arguments of OERs in the political arena. This approach has gained significant political capital because politicians can say ""we're saving students money on textbooks"" while at the same time cutting funding for state schools. Folks will argue these are two separate issues, but I find that hard to swallow. Content truly is infrastructure for a contingent workforce ??   2. You can have a rider on these purchasing contracts that enable other Virginia agencies to use this contract to get a similar set of terms and conditions that have already been vetted. In effect, it vets the vendor for the system, but there is no way to know this in Virginia unless you study the dark art of purchasing bureaucracy.  "Jim Groom,Six Months an Apprentice,http://bavatuesdays.com/six-months-an-apprentice/,2/25/2016,"Since late July, early August I have been focusing a lot more of my time on wrapping my head around the Reclaim Hosting server infrastructure, as well as providing support to folks using it. It's been a welcome deviation from the career trajectory I've been on for the last ten years. You see, when you get into edtech in higher ed, often you have the starting position of something like instructional technologist, learning designer, media specialist, etc. You can then move on to something like coordinator, manager, assistant director, or director. In some instances, and with the right credentials, there may even be more ? some kind of assistant VP or associate provost gig. But in the end, it's all pretty much middle management admin hell after instructional technologist ? the only truly pure job. And, as you are pushed along this pre- defined career track, it's easy to move further and further away from the actual work and deeper and deeper into a culture of meetings, administrative trivia, and managing others. Don't get me wrong, some folks like this stuff and are good at it, but that's only because they have been institutionally lobotomized ??  Anyway, I got off that carousel of denial in September, and one of the nicest things has been that I could focus more of my energy on the actual work. Not managing up or expectations or for success, or any of that nonsense. I avoided this for about as long as I could at UMW, but the writing was on the wall: you can't remain outside of the expectations of institutional conformity forever if you want to be a house cat. I remember during the EDUPUNK insurgency folks called me out for being a hypocrite proclaiming some vision of ""radical"" edtech (why is shunning clunky corporate tools radical?) while working as part of an institution and being insulated by the freedom and security of higher ed. But for me any sense of security and freedom in higher ed increasingly vanished over my ten year career. By leaving I was actually able to return to doing the work I love without feeling the psychic drain of being pulled in a million different directions.  So, six months later (and with fewer friends ?? ) I'm in the process of re- focusing my work on how to build, scale, and support a web hosting infrastructure alongside Tim Owens, who has been the best teacher you can imagine. Neither of us have any experience in running a business, so we have been very practical in our approach. We decided early on to be completely free of investment money, loans or debt of any kind. And we have been able to do that by running the business lean. Our main overhead is server costs, licensing fees for cPanel and WHMCS, and over the last year salaries. This year we have started building a reserve so we can avoid the misguided logic of constant growth and scale as the irrefutable recipe to success. We're not trying to become hosting magnates, rather to be a sustainable, independent edtech shop. Indie EdTech #4life.  Getting to this point has been no mystery. We have a network of folks that supported us as we got started. There is no question they've been, and continue to be, crucial to our success. But that can only go so far when you're providing a service folks depend on. So, we approached this practically as well: simply provide stellar service. And I think we have done that so far.  > I picked a bad day to quit sniffing glue. https://t.co/ocbZ5QKbHR  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) February 24, 2016  As yesterday can attest to, everything isn't always perfect in Reclaimland and we have our issues time and again. But we communicate with our community regularly about any and all problems, as well as our ideas, aspirations, and principles. We understand the work we do as part of a broader conversation, which means it is not alienated and divorced from what people are trying to do conceptually. I think it's apparent when you have a technical issue that we're going to solve it fast, but folks also recognize that every communication is part of a larger conversation around empowering the edtech community to reclaim the web for teaching and learning ? something I remain passionate about even if I'm a bit burnt on institutional culture.  All that said, I am very much an apprentice in this whole enterprise. I've been learning tons about cPanel server administration since August. I have setup numerous Domain of One's Own packages; experimented with getting self- hosted versions of Sandstorm spun-up; and migrated institutional servers over to Linode. It's been really rewarding to have the time and energy to get schooled in what should be one of the core competencies of edtech: agile infrastructure. I'm not necessarily there yet, but I'm closer than I was 6 months ago, and I'm not letting up anytime soon.  "Jim Groom,Creating a Reseller Account in CPanel,http://bavatuesdays.com/creating-a-reseller-account-in-cpanel/,3/8/2016,"What is a reseller account, and why would I want to create one? Often times we get requests that a user would like to manage two separate web hosting accounts in cPanel. Or a faculty member would like access to various student cPanel accounts. By adding reseller privileges to an account, as illustrated below, you can provide access to one or more cPanel accounts for any given user without them needing that cPanel accounts login credentials. The additional accounts simply show up in a dropdown menu in their cPanel Dashboard, and they can switch between various accounts. That's the why.  Here's the how:  You can start by using the Create a New Account feature in WHM, the CPanel WebHost Manager.?  Figure 1: Create a New Account in CPanel  You will need to fill in the account details, such as domain, username, a strong password and an email. The email can be the same used for another account, or it can be different.  Figure 2: Add domain information for new account.  You will need to choose a package, in this example Default, and if you like you can decide to override certain account settings by choosing Select Options Manually (which is unchecked in this example).  Figure 3: Choose a package (in this case Default)  Make sure you choose the Reseller Privileges option during setup for the new account.  Figure 4: Enable Reseller Privileges  After the account is all set, confirm the creation of a new account. After that, you will now need to click the Modify Account button for the account you intend to be the reseller. So, for example, you just created the account econoproph.net, and you want that to be owned by the account jimluke.openlcc.net. You would need to modify the jimluke.openlcc.net account and give it reseller privileges.  Figure 5: Modify Account you want to be the Reseller  Figure 6: Enable Reseller Privileges on Reseller Account  Once you have done that save the new settings. Keep in mind you want to choose Keep this account package ïDefault' (not recommended) as your save option.  Figure 7: Save new account settings  Now you have to change one more feature of the reseller account, you need to select the that account as the Account Owner. So, in this example, jimluke.openlcc.net will be the account owner, rather than being owned by root or the new account we just created.  Figure 8: Select Reseller Account from dropdown  Save the changes.  Figure 9: Save new account settings  After that you need to modify the new account you created, i.e., econoproph.net.  Figure 10: Modify new account  Here we make the account owner the jimluke.openlcc.net reseller account.?  Figure 11: Make reseller account account owner  Save settings, not recommended is recommended.  Figure 12: Save New Account Settings  Now, if you were login to the account jimluke.openlcc.net, you would see a dropdown option in the cPanel Dashboard enabling me to switch between accounts.  Figure 13: Dropdown option in Dashboard for both accounts  That should be everything. If you are using WHMCS, you would want to Add a New Order to the user's account post facto.  Figure 14: Add a new order for user in WHMCS  Figure 15: Add web hosting as new product  Once you submit, just make sure the module that actually creates the new account on cPanel, Run Module Create, is unchecked, as well as the option to Send Welcome Email for new accounts.  Figure 16: Uncheck Run Module Create and Send Welcome Email  You should also make sure the usernames match and you click the Change Password module to ensure they're in sync.  Figure 17: Make sure your product username matches the one you sued in cPanel and be sure to click on the ""Change password"" module to sync passwords.  And that's how you create a Reseller Account in cPanel, something as a faculty member in the early days of ds106 I would have found very, very useful for getting a sense of who is doing what on their domain by easily switching to their accounts. We also realized this approach was useful for student organization or club sites because upon someone's leaving or graduation it could be easily transferred to another student or faculty within cPanel.      1. Alternatively, you could also start by creating a new hosting product in WHMCS directly for the user who wants the additional hosting, and have that automatically create the new cPanel account. This may be good practice because you would have a searchable record of the new account in WHMCS. The only thing you would need to add was the ""reseller privileges"" checkbox for the newly created account (figure 4). Other wise, you could pickup from figure 5 after creating the account in WHMCS, if you so desire. Also, you can obviously forego figures 14-17 given you will have done that already.   2. I am using the great Jim Luke as an example here, though econoproph.net is not a real site, he would be moving econproph.net over, and that will be a different process given he already maintains that site within the Reclaim empire (big fan!). That will be using the transfer tool, and I'll do a post on that wonderful CPanel utility soon.  "Jim Groom,The Personal in Indie,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-personal-in-indie/,3/24/2016,"Against my better judgement, I've been temporarily expatriated from my heavily guarded mountain compound in Italy to slum amongst the Trump loving scum in the U.S. God I hate this country! But enough about the King, let's talk Indie Ed""-""Tech. This past weekend a bunch of folks descended upon Davidson College to talk about a series of ideas and possibilities that have been percolating in the field of educational technology for a few years now. Special thanks to Adam Croom and Kristen Eshleman for making it all possible through adroitly organizing and focusing our time together.  There is a lot to talk about, and luckily many people have already done it far better than I can, so let me take you through a brief review of the event literature thus far. In terms of primary resources, Audrey Watter's talk""I Love My Label"" which kicked-off the event was phenomenal ? I will return to it at the end of this post ? but that's an awesome starting point.  Kin Lane followed Audrey with a workshop on APIs, and the site he created at ""The Personal API and Indie Ed""-""Tech"" is a veritable treasure trove of resources about how APIs inform the discussion of Indie.  Alan Levine wrote the first reflective post on the event because he's the last of the Bloghicans, and it was cool to see how Kin and Audrey's indie magic has begun to get the dog inspired ? the blog wags the tail.  Adam Croom was next up with a 3-part opus on the event, highlighting the ways Audrey and Kin framed Indie Ed""-""Tech, the all-day Design Sprint, and finally a post on futures and funding. If Adam Croom's blog hasn't become a staple for you yet, I can only wonder why. The work he and his team have done at Oklahoma with OU Create is quickly becoming the stuff of Ed""-""Tech legend. UMW may have invented Domain of One's Own, but OU is perfecting it. Wanna know what one flavor of indie ed""-""tech looks like? Just take a peek at their group, empowering a community, highlighting the awesome work, pounding the pavement, doing class visits, touring the campus, and bringing the good word to the people. The proof is always in the work. An indie ed""-""tech spends her life getting into tense situations.  Tim Klapdor framed the encounter as the beginnings of a journey to explore the protean idea of Indie Ed""-""Tech, the becoming of a creative, exploratory process from which a culture may emerge and grow ? an opportunity the MOOCs never got because they quickly became an over-hyped silver bullet to solve the world's problems. Klapdor's idea that ""Indie Ed-tech is infrastructure that supports scholarly agency and autonomy"" is brilliantly stated, and he goes on a bit of a tear from there:  > Indie represents an alternative vision for how technology might operate in education. The Indie mindset challenges and changes the existing power distribution and dynamics that are often at the heart of the issues we face. It emphasises networked rather than centralised practices and the relationships built through collaboration and cooperation. It empower users by allowing for greater choice, diversity and individual representation and expression.  Those vegemite sandwiches are no joke!  But that's not all, no, that's not all! There's more, and this time the reflections come from a grad student in Education at BYU Olga Belikov, whom I first met 5 years ago on #ds106radio thanks to Bryan Jackson (as an aside, his recent post on Taylor Swift songs rules). So, a high school senior from Vancouver in 2011 is now researching and writing about indie edtech ? how awesome. She wrote two posts, one about Audrey's ""I Love My Label"" keynote and another about Kin's Personal API workshop, read both. Pull quote:  > Indie Ed-Tech to me is about equity, about accessibility. It's about working against the institutional culture that precludes those who want to learn from doing so by limiting their access to knowledge.  Andƒ  > Technology isn't an industry disruptor in education, it enable networks that we could never have dreamed up before. My romance with ed-tech began with my experiences that led me to see the capacity that technology has to create connected learning environments. We have that capacity to create distributed knowledge networks and indie ed-tech can enable these networks. Even within an intimate gathering of few individuals at Davidson, I was able to see my pre- existing learning networks clash and grow.  I'm getting verklempt over here.  And then that hack Watters was at it again, not only did she lay down the gospel, but she resurfaced for a homily in her post on the weekend framing what Indie Ed""-""Tech need not be:  > Ed-tech need not be exploitative. Ed-tech need not be extractive. Ed-tech need not be punitive. Ed-tech need not be surveillance. Ed-tech need not assume that the student is a cheat. Ed-tech need not assume that the student has a deficit. Ed-tech need not assume that learning can be measured or managed. Ed-tech need not scale.  And last post I have read was by Tim Owens' reflections on the weekend.  > You can play to an audience of your peers in a living room and that in and of itself can be its own reward. We need not have stages filled with passionate fans, it's perfectly acceptable to build small, tight-knit communities that are personal and intimate.  Andƒ  > I'd hoped that whatever we imagined possible we could make equitable and accessible by resisting an urge to have it be any one big thing. A modular approach to Indie Ed-Tech is, in my eyes, absolutely necessary.  Andƒ  > Questions remain about sources of funding for innovation, but personally I'm less concerned about that than a deeper drive to continue building a powerful community that can contribute to this space in greater ways. This event reinforced for me that the conversations we're having are absolutely relevant.  Those Reclaim Hosting people are smart!  I think that's my recap of the literature thus far, but this post is already too long so let me try and be brief with my own take aways from the weekend. An Indie Ed""-""Tech anything as well as the API to go along with it has to be personal. And I mean this in the Tom Woodward sense of the word, which is Alabamese for weird. If whatever you are doing doesn't get you excited, it's probably not all that personal. Tom Woodward's Insta Snoop  is for me a model of the personal API. Insta Snoop looks ""at Snoop Dogg's Instagram followers and plot their change very 10 minutes.""  Tom grabbed the data from Snoop's Instagram and mapped it to a Google Spreadsheet to map the scale of celebrity social media follow rates. This is a fascinating form of data/digital literacy, it is intensely purpose, and it makes APIs and data interesting. It's a riff, or a song, or a story. It's playful and thoughtful at once. It gets us away from coming up with a spec to define a thing. That will and should happen, but if we start there we are doomed.  The other point that really blew my mind this weekend was Audrey's reframing of the whole idea of ""personalized learning"" as an algorithm to make everything the same was nothing short of masterful recasting of the current data-driven nightmare in ed""-""tech to challenge the idea of personalized being sold presently:  > Like all sorts of industries, music and education alike are now supposed to bow to the new insights discoverable thanks to ""big data."" Algorithms and analytics will ""personalize"" our world, we're told. The problem, of course, is that the algorithms and the analytics also make everything sound the same. That's the business: a neoliberal mirage around ""choice."" Standardization. A familiar and managed image. Profiled. Labeled.  Her whole riff on how the music industry, and by analogy education, is pushing towards creating and predicting some imaginary ""perfect song"" effectively demonstrates how our obsession with data is removing any sense of personalization from the experience. I particularly love the poles of personal between Tom's Insta Snoop and Audrey's Insta Hit. Both strike me as so sharp, so creative, so insightful, and so full of desire to stop the madness.    I stole all of the above pictures from both Tom Woodward and Alan Levine's Flickr streams unless otherwise noted ??  "Jim Groom,The View from Here,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-view-from-here/,3/29/2016,"The view from the bava home office  I'm pretty happy today. It doesn't hurt that it is a glorious day here in Trento, Italy, and the Spring is slowly creeping back into this mountain detachment. But that's not the only reason I am feeling good these days, I am also digging the energy brewing online amongst folks I call friends and colleagues. There are a lot of potential vectors to follow, but let me start with Kin Laneïs project wherein he created a ""simple, client side RSS aggregator that runs 100% on Github."" There has been no shortage of love for Kin after the IndieEd""-""Tech Summit at Davidson College (as it should be), and I came across this project thanks to this post featuring the ""Allow Cross Origin Access to Feeds"" plugin whipped up by Tom Woodward in order to enable Kin's RSS aggregator to work on WordPress. Love that, people making small stuff that might be useful to others, and in turn others build on top of it.  Room with a Croom  In fact, that reminds me of another source of joy for me on the web over the last few days. Adam Croom shared out an awesome blog post about ""A Vinyl API of One's Own"" in which he seamlessly tied together his engagement photos, his love affair with vinyl, and the idea of personalizing APIs to relate to something that means something to him, namely a record collection. He pointed to the site Discogs that is trying to build the most comprehensive database of music on the web that other can contribute to. And guess what, they have an API! So cool, and it reinforces the idea of truly making the API personal by linking it to something you care deeply about.  Cool right, well it doesn't end there. That crazy bastard Woodward wasn't done yet (what a roll he is on)! Tom read Adam's post, and figured it would be an interesting experiment for him to see how Adam might get his data out of Discogs and into something like WordPress:  > Adam had information in Discogs. He wanted that information in WordPress where he could control it. I had never heard of the site, let alone seen it's API. But it well documented and it took me a few minutes to realize I could get all the data I needed without even needing to authenticate.  From there a small, focused plugin was born, and Tom is getting ever closer to code mastery. But it doesn't end there, Adam reads Tom's post, marvels at this brave new web with such people on it works. He then built his Vinyl Subdomain site thanks to some help and inspiration from a fellow traveler.  vinyl.adamcroom.com  This all makes me happy because it's good. People sharing stuff they care about. Focused energy for understanding and creating something, what could be better? I think Audrey Watter's resistance to defining Indie Ed""-""Tech too specifically is right on, let it breath. Let others run with it, just make sure it is not a few thingsƒ.  > Ed-tech need not be exploitative. Ed-tech need not be extractive. Ed-tech need not be punitive. Ed-tech need not be surveillance. Ed-tech need not assume that the student is a cheat. Ed-tech need not assume that the student has a deficit. Ed-tech need not assume that learning can be measured or managed. Ed-tech need not scale.  And when I see this exchange between Tom and Adam I am buoyed to no end by would it is and can be. Of all things I enjoy online, there is nothing better than being part of a small, passionate community coming together for the simple fact that it makes my online life more fun. Totally selfish, but also totally awesome.  "Jim Groom,Now in Stereo,http://bavatuesdays.com/now-in-stereo/,4/4/2016,"Bryan Mathers sent me another gorgeous addition to the Reclaim Hosting Record Store aesthetic. The ""Now In Stereo"" refers to the fact that we have 30 days of file-level, off-site backups that come stock with our shared hosting. In fact, we have started to push this out as stock for our Domain of One's Own packages as well. Stereo being double the awesome ? get it? We knew that ya could. But as is often the case with Bryan's work, this goes beyond any one feature of Reclaim Hosting, it speaks to a broader aesthetic. This one filled me with nostalgia for the clean, off-white record sleeves, and the sense of depth achieved with the albums sticking out provided a patina of materiality. I am digging the range of effects. In fact, I've pretty much loved everything Bryan has created for us.  Last Friday Bryan and I spent 30 or 40 minutes chatting about stuff. I don't exactly know what we want, I just have a vague sense of things I think are cool. One things I have been digging on recently is the 1990s poster art for the LA coffe house/indie scene mecca Jabberjaw. I picked up a book featuring a pictorial history of some of the bands and poster art that helped define the post-punk indie scene.What struck me was how coupled the poster art was with the music, and what I have loved about Bryan's work is his use of colors. The EDUPUNK image is amazing example of that.  While there was a fair amount of Xeroxed black and white fliers with dead simple designs, the posters where a kaleidoscope of color. In fact, the call gave me the opportunity to unpack the Jabberjaw poster that came with the book, which was also the cover for one of the record compilations produced by the venue.  One of the things that we discussed is the way in which the various clubs and venues would be tattooed with stickers, fliers, posters, etc. The walls would become a textual and visual history of all that came before it. In fact, a retrospective of the Riot Grrrl movement called Alien She collected a large swath of the posters and fliers from 1991 onward.  Riot Grrrl Poster Retrospective  And while this vision of the posters and fliers is a bit defanged by the museum setting, the walls of CBGBs provide a better sense of how this might look like in the wild:  What were the walls of CBGBs  Our discussion led us to how record stores feature stuff. One way is simply by what's playing. If you would walk into a record store you would immediately tun into what music they are listening too. Same in the old time video stores, they would often have a movie playing that you would key into, I know I did. The other thing is what's lined up around and behind the counter, a featuring of sorts. A recommendation rack? Or there could also be a catalog, etc. Which started me thinking about the site Adam Croom created recently to feature his vinyl collection. He tapped into the data on Discogs to populate his own site.  vinyl.adamcroom.com  So what if we did something similar for our Reclaim Hosting recommendation rack. We pulled from the IndieEdtech blogosphere highlighting various projects both inside and outside institutions to share the work happening. In fact, you don't need an algorithm or API for this, just the focus and attention the keep up with what's happening. One way at that might be focused aggregation ? which makes me think how we might put the IndieEdTech RSS aggregator to use, and eventually start duct taping together an aggregation hub at an indieedtech.tld site. This would be something Reclaim Hosting could use to follow and feature work we are excited about, as well as push out our own news and announcements to ? as could anyone else so inclined to do so. What is that aggregation site looked like poster/flier filled wall? {MIND BLOWN}  I'll stop thereƒ.

"Jim Groom,The Reclaiming Innovation Roadshow at Coventry University,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-reclaiming-innovation-roadshow-at-coventry-university/,5/22/2016,"At the end of April Brian Lamb and I spent three days on the ground at Coventry University. We were cordially invited by the great Daniel Villar- Onrubia given his interest in an EDUCAUSE Review article we wrote back in 2014 titled ""Reclaiming Innovation."" I think the polemic Brian started the article with around questions of disruption and innovation are near and dear to a larger vision Coventry University's Disruptive Media Learning Lab (DMLL) is working through:  > Today, innovation is increasingly conflated with hype, disruption for disruption's sake, and outsourcing laced with a dose of austerity-driven downsizing. If any concept should be seen as an uncomplicated good thing in higher education, it's innovation. Defined by a common-sense notion of ""doing things better"" and burnished by the sheen of dazzling technological advances, what's not to like about innovation?  >  > Yet as 2014 churns on, the glow is wearing off. Today, innovation is increasingly conflated with hype, disruption for disruption's sake, and outsourcing laced with a dose of austerity-driven downsizing. Call it innovation fatigue.  >  > How did we get here? And if innovation is still something we are interested in fostering, what are the values that should animate it? What goals and strategies should we be pursuing if we want to reclaim innovation as a positive force as higher education continues to engage with digital and networked technologies?  This beautiful framing of the issues thanks to Brian was our ticket to Coventry, and Daniel worked with us for months before the event to try and frame a 3-day residence that would serve the community. The issue with this approach is Brian and I don't exactly have a healthy working relationship. Don't get me wrong, we love each other, but we also struggle psychically with one another on some deep levels. And I really felt bad for Daniel given he put himself in the situation of trying to referee and direct this unstable collaborative energy. Usually when Brian and I get together for any extended period of time it proves generative, but at an immediate cost to our individual well-being. We constantly rib each other with deep questions and challenges that undergird the basic assumptions and prevailing logic of the work we do and the people we are ? it's a morbid kind of anti-therapy. A process that often feeds off our insecurities, which at times I think would make us an unstoppable comedy team if this edtech field ever does actually legit-a- demise. That said, there is no question I do my best thinking and feel most deeply attached and responsible for the work I'm doing when I'm with Brian. He feeds a crucial place in my soul, and one that makes me feel alive and scared all at once. I'm not sure exactly how to fully explain it, but I know I am the better for it ? despite all the pain ??  All this to say, I didn't envy Daniel's position of bringing us together for a professional event that he was hoping would make a good impression on folks at Coventry. It was a risk, and I'm not being entirely tongue-in-cheek here. Things can go terribly wrong from an institutional perspective when Brian and I collaborate, it's happened before many years ago. The plan was fairly simple, we spend two days on the ground talking with various faculty members, ed-tech staff, and the DMLL folks themselves to share various approaches of how we can reclaim small bits of innovation through alternative ideas of ed- tech infrastructure. We even came up with a plan thanks to Brian, and he rolled out a brilliant site that maps our loosely structured workshop that we delivered to 4 different groups of faculty and staff over those two days (we probably met with between 60-80 folks). We talked GIFs, SPLOTs, Sandstorm, Domains, and more. We even setup Coventry with their own Sandstorm sandbox. And while only time will tell, it seems clear to me that Coventry is a university well-positioned to start exploring some of this stuff in more depth. They have curious faculty, folks to support them, and buy-in from the administration, so I'm excited to see what happens.  One of the real delights of these two days of workshops was listening to Brian pitch SPLOTs and Sandstorm. Brian and I fall in that liminal space between rarified thought leader and techie. We are very much technologists, but I like to think we're equal parts literature, cinema, music, and web. We love the technology of effective and creative communication, and we find ourselves in the historical moment when the web has become both the medium and the form of all of these things. Brian's workshop was a master class in starting small and simple with the SPLOT as a way to challenge assumptions about collecting data from our students, assuming everything eventually has to become a system, and that any of this has to be complicated to get started. In many ways the SPLOT is as much a small, finely-tuned ed-tech ethos as it is a tool, and Brian laid it down brilliantly in each and every workshop. In fact, I think we had more technologists and faculty interested in SPLOTs than anything else we showed off during our time at Coventry ? and that was a direct result of Brian's ability to make the case.  After an intense two days of workshops, on the third day was the DMLL Expo ""Lost in Disruption: Reclaiming Innovation."" This was campus event to showcase the work of DMLL through a wide array of presentations, panel discussions, and informal interactions. It was a great day, and I had a blast. The idea of bringing us in for a couple of days before-hand to meet with folks and get acquainted with the community was probably a big reason why our presentations and contributions might have resonated with folks. We didn't parachute in to broadcast our infinite wisdom. We were on the ground trying to get a sense of what was happening. Daniel worked us hard for three days, and that's what you should do when you bring folks in. Expose them to as many people in your community as possible and get conversations happening and ideas brewing.  That's exactly what happened for my own talk at the Expo. After being in 6 or 7 different conversations over the previous two days I decided to scrap my presentation the morning of the event and start fresh. Brian had noted that my OER16 presentation was pretty ds106 heavy, and it was. He wasn't necessarily challenging me on that, but it did make me think about Martin Weller's recent post about the keynote dilemma. My presentations are never necessarily identical, but they do rely on a lot of the core elements of the work I've been a part of over the last decade: the early Bluehost experiment, UMW Blogs, ds106, Domain of One's Own, Reclaim Hosting, etc. There's an obvious narrative arc to this work, at least for me, and I don't make any pretensions to being a researcher or academic ? so I'm freed up to focus on the shit we did rather than the big ideas. That said, it feels almost like an obligation to talk ds106. And don't get me wrong, I have no problem doing it and it always feels fresh to me, but at the same time it has become apparent that's what people associate me with now. So, in a last minute attempt to change up I decided at about 8:30 AM to frame my talk around the work I did with Zach Whalen last year to create the UMW Console.  I had blogged the UMW Console pretty regularly last year and folks took tons of photos and videos. We even created a database of all the artifacts, so putting this talk together was fairly easy. [Reason number 78,974 to blog.] I simply linked out to about 4 or 5 blog posts and narrated the thinking behind the UMW Console, how we did it, and what it meant for re-thinking some of the ideas the folks at DMLL were trying to explore, such as flipped classrooms, gaming, etc.. What would it mean to design and build alternative spaces like the an 1980s living room to re-imagine how we program and inhabit learning spaces. I think it fit the spirit of this group well because it opened up innovation and disruption as small, communal, and fairly cheap endeavors. It wasn't about a system as much as it was about exploring cultural history as mediated and informed by and through technology. I keep going back to Audrey Watters's brilliant talk about the Discovery Channel and the history of TV and broadcast networks. The idea that we were re-creating a moment where the political map of networks are very different given the predominance of television and radio, not to mention the material culture of music and video. It opens up a different space to explore this through, and teaching could use that space in some new and exciting ways.  I think the presentation hit home for some, and I may very well be returning to Coventry some time soon to start working with Daniel, Helen Keegan, Luca Morini (whose talk on gaming was brilliant), Kate Green, and many more to start building out some of the small infrastructure Brian and I shared, as well as imagining a teaching and learning space from 1995. Just think of the possibilities. What if we were to re-create a networked computer lab from 1995 and teach HTML classes in it? Full with machines of the era loaded with Windows 95, MS Office, Pegasus Mail, Doom, Duke Nukem, Earthworm Jim, and so much more! How much of the web from Fall of 1995 could we reproduce and build out as an experience? What if we could get .net artist Olia Lialina to give a talk and run a Dr Professor workshop for us as an invited artist? But this all may be wishful thinking, but damn it would be awesome.  So, at the end of the day I left Coventry feel elated, and no small part of that feeling was meeting all the great people at Coventry and a successful collaboration with Brian ? none of which would have been possible without the adept guidance of Daniel. It was an intense 3 or 4 days, and when Brian and I came back to Italy after that I think were both physically and mentally exhausted, but as Brian's own post on the our time in Edinburgh (more on that in another post) and Coventry suggests, it was a much needed winch to lift us out of the slough of despond ??  Here are the slides from my talk. I'm not sure how useful they will be given most of it was extemporaneous. Also, one of the things I realized is that I should be building sites with links I discuss in my talks, much like Brian did for his rather than Google slide decks. I have to rectify this in the future if I'm, indeed, still giving talks. I believe there is a video of the talk somewhere, and I know it was live streamed on the day of the conference. That said, I cannot locate it online presently. If and when it surfaces I'll include the link below.  Update 6/20/17:  Video of this talk is now on Youtube, I can die happy.    She tried to give this talk in Barcelona last year at EDEN15 ? but too many formalities and long-winded introductions got in the way. The Europeans really need to tone down their formalities because it cost them a great presentation.  "Jim Groom,Changing Storage Quota for cPanel Accounts,http://bavatuesdays.com/changing-storage-quota-for-cpanel-accounts/,5/29/2016,"This is a quick and easy tutorial for changing storage space quotas on specific cPanel accounts, perfect for a rainy Sunday morning. I often get this question from someone managing a Domain of One's Own initiative that needs to modify an account to allow for more storage space.  This process is done in WHM, which is basically the GUI interface for managing all the accounts on cPanel. Once logged in you do a quick find using the word ""list"" (no quotes) in the left upper hand corner. Then click ""List Accounts"" which will allow you to search for the account you need. You can search by the username or domain as demonstrated below.  From there click on the + button next to the domain and you will see a series of options, include a blue ""Change Quota"" button. Click on it.  From there you can change the quota to the appropriate size and save it.  Now that account should have enough storage. We often build in a hard cap for storage, something like 1 or 2 GBs to avoid using up a server's space too quickly. But this feature allows a quick override for special instances, which can be useful when a student, staff, or faculty member simply needs more space.  That's it. Easy, right?  "Debra Schleef,Who's Afraid of Domain of One's Own?,http://umwdtlt.com/whos-afraid-domain-ones/,6/3/2016,"# Who's Afraid of Domain of One's Own?  June 3, 2016  |In Domain of One's Own  |By Debra Schleef  ""A student must have a domain of her own if she is to writeƒ""  I was surprised to learn, in a recent conversation with colleagues, that although there are clear and justifiable connections between ""Domain of One's Own"" (hereafter, DoOO) and Virginia Woolf's extended essay A Room of One's Own from which the initiative gets its title, we could identify no one who had written substantively about those connections. In some references, only Woolf's picture appears, with no mention at all of the book or its contents.  After our DoOO Book Club reading and conversation about Woolf's book, I decided to write more thoughtfully about the relationship between the two. Two caveats: I am neither an expert on Virginia Woolf nor on Domain of One's Own. Instead, I am relying on my own reading of the book and my colleagues' thoughts on what we read. The conversation took the form of some questions posed by UMW Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies Executive Director Jesse Stommel, and I do my best to reconstruct them here.  Should we make more obvious the connection between DoOO and Woolf?  What does it mean, both literally and figuratively, to have a room of one's own? Woolf's room with a lock, and resources (the famous ""500 pounds a year,"" but also education, time, and access) provides a place within which the figurative can flower. Similarly, a domain is more than a delimited internet space with your name on it?it is a figurative room that provides time, creative license, and a space to express oneself freely. Part of our discussion revolved around what people are most lacking that prevents them from fully using their domains. The time and space to write? Or is it something deeper than that?the need for a place to write and create without fear?  What can Woolf tell us about the goals of DoOO?  ""So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say."" We can see in Woolf's essay instructions on how to locate the space to find, develop, and write in one's own style. A similar goal undergirds DoOO. Though this approach is more difficult and potentially risky, it has been critical that this writing be both public and allow students to take part of a wider digital conversation, one that is ultimately not dictated by others, including their instructors.  What does that work look like, and how can we best encourage that free expression?  ""But to sacrifice a hair of the head of your vision, a shade of its colour, in deference to some Headmaster with a silver pot in his hand or to some professor with a measuring-rod up his sleeve, is the most abject treachery."" Woolf's reader gets a profound sense of the stifling nature of education at Oxbridge with its ""only one right way,"" clearly oppressive not only to the women of the time. How do the professors and staff structure the learning process so that use of DoOO is not yet another required course task but one that is empowering? How do you move from a tool taught by a professor to one a student can use as she chooses? How can we use DoOO within a course framework while not inhibiting students' own creative impulses? Students are often at a loss as to what to do with all this unstructured freedom, or maybe don't yet believe that they are capable of this type of work. How do we create a safe space where students can practice that freedom?  How does Woolf help us think about identity?  Woolf tries on multiple other identities in her book, much as students might choose to do with their domains. She narrates her piece as multiple characters named Mary who exist in potentially dangerous spaces outside marriage or motherhood. She also invents fictional women authors to demonstrate the difficulties women writers have being taken seriously. Identity as a concept is central to DoOO. Students learn how to develop their own online presence. They gain knowledge to protect their identities online, but more importantly, they learn to take control or manipulate their online identities in numerous ways. Students can take risks (or not) with these personas in a safe space as they develop more fully.  Should DoOO have an explicitly feminist voice?  Woolf's short book has now become a classic feminist text (not everyone in our group was initially aware of this). Should students learning about DoOO also learn about this? UMW, of course, is an historically a women's college, with a strong women's and gender studies program and prominent feminist voices represented among faculty and students. Another connection might involve recognition that Woolf is writing at the tail end of fundamental shifts for women (voting rights, first wave feminism), much as this is a time of great upheaval for students, digital identity, and online learning. On the other hand, concerns about access and social justice which might be prompted by Woolf could actually take us beyond feminism to think about other social justice concerns related to DoOO. The book does not limit us to discussing women and sexual politics, but extends to social class, economics and other forms of power.  What other inequalities might DoOO address in terms of cultural capital, social justice, access?  Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers, classified as second-class citizens. With no wealth of her own and no title, no one would take a women writer seriously. ""In the first place, to have a room of her ownƒ was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble."" Nevertheless, in 1929, even Woolf, as an upper middle class married woman with an inheritance from an aunt, does have the 500 pounds, along with time and the space to write.  What other inequalities could be addressed with DoOO? Generational differences? Young college students' work online, like the writing of women in the early 20th century, can often be delegitimated as ""scribbling."" The digital divide? How do we ensure that all of our students not only have equal access to DoOO but also feel equally comfortable with information and communication technologies provided by the project? How would we address further inequities presented for students who might be further marginalized in a liberal arts setting, such as adult students, first generation college students, students with disabilities, and so forth? If empowerment is to happen with DoOO, it must happen for all.  How is the connection between Woolf and DoOO central to the liberal arts enterprise?  She asks, in the absence of fiction and history on women, how do we actually ""know"" women? So classic liberal arts questions such as, What is knowledge? What can we do with it? How do we know? What is meant by reality? can link Woolf to conversations we've been having about how DoOO fits within one's education (as well reveal the false dichotomy between liberal arts and digital technology yet again).  Finally, how do we use DoOO and liberal arts education to empower students? Perhaps more to the point, how do we create systems that don't disempower? The tautology this choice might evoke: This gives the student the power to choose to remain on line, to curtain one's online presence, or not after graduation. A choice to keep one's domain, to change it significantly, or not to use it at all. (Bear in mind the not inconsequential fact that teaching students this might negatively impact the way our own institutional evaluators assess the success of DoOO).  But what did we eat?  ""Novelists have a way of making us believe that luncheon parties are invariably memorable for something very witty that was said, or for something very wise that was done. But they seldom spare a word for what was eaten."" It wasn't until I finished this essay that colleagues reminded me that we talked about this very quote, and what it underscores about the importance typically placed on arenas that are publicly male (discourse) versus privately female (domestic). In that spirit, let me add that although it's possible nothing very witty was said, we did have some lovely nachos and margaritas.  In the end, we don't have all the answers to the questions posed above. This is just the beginning of the meal. Please join us in a broader discussion of the role that Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own can play in the Domain of One's Own community.

See you soon @kdragon87 @jimgroom @NateCooper pic.twitter.com/hd6qS9U7my  >  >  ?  Sandra Markus (@slmarkusnyc) June 6, 2016  Yesterday I had the distinct pleasure of kicking off Fashion Institute of Technology's Digital Spa run by Sandra Markus and Kurt Vega. They are focusing this year's week-long faculty development workshop on getting folks up and running with their own domain, and when we talked a few months back I recommended they take a look at the Faculty Initiative resources the we created at UMW for the 6 week introduction to Domains for faculty. It's cool to see they have integrated elements of that approach into their workshop; caring is sharing. I firmly believe a Domains project is only as strong as the community created around it, let the OU Creaties stand as a testament to that.  For my part of the Digital Spa, I was there to give a sense of the project's history and raison d'etre, if you will. It's a story I have shared often, and it's one I never tire of telling. But given I would be presenting via Hangouts to a fairly small group I dispensed with a slideshow. I did use a visual aides and web sites, but I wanted the tone to be conversational given the shared purpose and focus of the event.  I think it was fairly successful given it kept my talk relatively short at 35-40 minutes, and allowed the Q&A to run at about the same length, that's a fairly decent balance if you can manage it. The only issue is I love to talk, and it's hard to shut me up even during the Q&A.  One of the things I discovered while preparing for this talk was that a domain I shared from a couple of years back by then UMW Art major Sidney Mullis was still active, but totally different. The screenshot I took a couple of years ago looked like this:  Two years later the domain name is active and working, but it has in many ways become her art. The front page of sidneymullis.com looks like this:  What's animating there are 3 YouTube videos set to automatically play and repeat that have these crazy creature creations that she designed. I love the whole thing, here is one of the videos:  So the domain itself has transformed as the artist has, while at the same time remaining a pointer to her work and thinking. I couldn't have found a better demonstration of the power of the domain. And this re-enforces many of the points I lifted from Mark Sample's post outlining the logic undergirding Davidson Domains:  > Something for all higher ed. faculty to think about. @jimgroom @kdragon87 @samplereality #digitalspa16 pic.twitter.com/KLwhozv0Lj  >  >  ?  Sandra Markus (@slmarkusnyc) June 6, 2016  I really enjoyed this session. It was almost entirely extemporaneous, an approach that often keeps things compelling (at least for me) when presenting remotely. I also loved the questions because they demonstrated that these sessions aren't about ""selling"" folks on the value of a domain and web hosting, the value of having a domain is everywhere apparent in 2016. What faculty want from a session like this is inspiration via examples of different ways people have used their domains as well as technical guidance for what's possible. One question that summed this up for me was a faculty member wondering if she could export her work from Blogger to WordPress. Short answer yes, and a question like that demonstrates folks are already in this space, but hosting and its innumerable affordances represent a new trove of online wonders.  Another question that was spot on was what happens when Reclaim Hosting (or fill in any 3rd party hosting service free or otherwise) goes away? The answer was simple, make sure you can backup/download your data and that it's portable. No matter what service you use, this is probably very good advice more generally. And it makes the broader point that with a Domains initiative this question undergirds the entire project ? take control of your online archive because no one will care more about the work you do online than you.  Thanks to Sandra and Kurt for letting me kick things off yesterday, it was an honor and a privilege, and to all those faculty, staff, and students out thereƒ.

Anyway, I was asked how I would approach framing a Domain of One's Own initiative to convince admin this is valuable, and my take is fairly simple: it's cheap as hell and can actually conform to and be driven by the needs of your community. So below is a quick copy and paste of my advice column email because I can:  > ƒI think the points I might focus on in practical terms is that this can be a small pilot to experiment and also quite affordable. The DoOO package is in increments of 500 users and includes single sign-on, backups, etc. This allows you to see if it makes sense for your community, while at the same time not being an enterprise cost structure. That package is $500/month, and no hidden costs. That's it, so that would be one important point.  >  > The other is that such a project would be best accomplished in conjunction with faculty and departments who want to explore alternative visions of portfolios, digital literacy, etc. Building a learning community during the pilot year would be optimal. It gives the project direction and community ownership, and it allows folks to explore it for their own research, scholarship, and teaching. I would also encourage including staff in such a cohort from the library, student services, etc.  >  > In my mind those are two crucial point[s]: affordable and community driven. After that, you can assess growth and scale if it proves useful/successful.  "Jim Groom,Digital Dioramas,http://bavatuesdays.com/digital-dioramas/,6/11/2016,"Image credit: Vince Smith's ""Early Humans Diorama""  On Wednesday I was able to tune into the Decentralized Web Summit for a couple of hours thanks to the live stream. The event was hosted in the web's chapel or, the Internet Archive. The video stream has all been archived, and you can access the entire proceedings from both days on YouTube ? here's a link to Day 1. I was really taken with Vint Cerfïs talk ""A Web that Archives Itself."" It's start's about 23 minutes in, and it's worth the half hour if you are interested in archiving the web.  This is the first time I have heard Vint Cerf speak, and I was really impressed. He did a brilliant job explaining the principles of the internet and the web, and was equal parts specific, general, and clear. It was apparent he was intentionally avoiding overly technical language, while being careful not to over simplify. It was a masterclass in making a complex process like archiving the web comprehensible. I have to go back and watch more of his talks because his style has much teach anyone trying to make this stuff accessible.  There were a few points he touched on during his talk I found really compelling for the work I'm doing right now, and I wanted to get them down here before Dr. Oblivion takes over.     The DNS domain system as it is currently setup is broken, an idea Tim Berners Lee re-iterated in his talk directly followed Cerf's. The idea of a lease-driven system folks pay for is responsible for much of the link rot and ephemeral nature of the web. This is something I want to dig into deeper because I know Dan Gillmor has discussed the deep dysfunction of ICANN on a few occasions.    The idea that everyone should have a domain for life. This is a similar idea to Jon Udell's seminal (at least for me) talk on ""The Disruptive Nature of Technology"" in 2007. Udell was not necessarily thinking in terms of a URL specifically there, but more of a hyper-secure repository that we control our digital life bits and use it as a hub to share access, etc. ? a more ""integrated domain"" for one's digital identity. That said the domain URL would be an important piece of this, and the idea that would be something everyone would get and have ""for ever"" from an archiving perspective is very compelling. You could still have vanity domains, but they would just be temporary aliases, not something that ever gets understood as the address (similar to the Digital Object Identifier system for published works). So, in short, we get a DOI-like identifier for our work that is also a URL that we can point various domain names at, etc, but always depends on a more permanent identifier.    The other idea I was taken by was how Cerf description of our current approach to web archiving as akin to creating a digital diorama: taking a two-dimensional snapshot, often by scraping sites. This is exactly what the Internet Archive has been doing for two decades, and more recently the Berkman Center's tool/plugin Amber does this for individual WordPress and Drupal sites. These digital dioramas capture a moment in time on the web often void of deep context given how we have imagined domains registration, URLs, etc.  I understand there is no easy solution to these issues, and that might be why I love thinking about them. I've been approached a few times recently with questions about how someone could keep a site up on the web indefinitely after they leave this earthly realm. I have no good answer. Putting a copy on the Internet Archive would be a good first step, but in terms of guaranteeing any longevity beyond 5 or 10 years as a hosting company would be disingenuous, not to mention impossible. I know this can quickly become a strangely morbid topic, but what happens to my digital domain actually matters as much to me as what happens to my Smurf collection, comic books, laser discs, Twilight Zone dolls, etc.    To be fair, there are some who see the temporality of content on the web as a feature not a bug, and this can coincide with privacy, surveillance, the right to be forgotten, etc.  "Jim Groom,OER16 In Conversation,http://bavatuesdays.com/oer16-in-conversation/,6/16/2016,"http://bavatuesdays.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/30/files/2016/06/jimgroom- ammienoot-oer16.mp3  In an ongoing effort to chronicle all the OER16 goodness, I wanted to point to this 20 minute conversation I had with Ammie Scott and John Johnston for Radio Edutalk. I just re-listened to the audio because it had been almost two months since we chatted and I was kinda foggy on the details.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover it was a fairly focused and cogent discussion around issues such as open educational infrastructure, personal archiving, and the tensions between ease-of-use and critically interrogating the digital space we inhabit. In those terms, we spent some time discussing SPLOTs versus managing one's own domain and web hosting.  The conversation then moved into the broader questions around personal archiving ? a space I continue to be fascinated with. The notion that no one will care more about your digital footprint than you, and the importance of thinking about we begin to start approaching the management and preservation of these digital lifebits. This led to questions around what Ammie noted were the ""limits of the archive,"" the idea that there are things you don't want to keep and that should also be a point of empowerment.  From there we talked about POSSE, or publishing on one's own site and syndicating everywhere. In this context Known came up, and one of the ongoing issues with a distributed POSSE publishing platform like Known is the lack of an integrated reader for context. Why don't publish to Twitter on Known? Simple, because I am not reading the tweets in Known, and I am too lazy to do twice the work. This led us back to where we started, which was kind of nice, the importance of balancing design and ease-of-use with distributed systems based on personal empowerment. And that was a wrap!  It was quite a fun conversation, and it tightly encapsulates many of the questions and concerns I want to spend much more of my time dealing with in the foreseeable future.  "Martha Burtis,"Coding, Serendipity, and Domain of One's Own",http://umwdtlt.com/coding-serendipity-domain-ones/,8/16/2016,"# Coding, Serendipity, and Domain of One's Own  August 16, 2016  |In Digital Liberal Arts, Domain of One's Own  |By Martha Burtis  Serendipity can be a wonderfully fruitful thing. Just after we had our first Domain of One's Own reading group, The New York Times published To Write Better Code, Read Virginia Woolf. In the piece, author J. Bradford Hipps eloquently defends the need for more humanities students, not to counteract or stand apart from the STEM fields but because the STEM fields themselves needs more humanists. This essay, alongside our discussion, has pushed my thinking even further on the importance of our DoOO initiative here at the University of Mary Washington.  Hipps recalls his own experience as a programmer with a large technology firm. Tasked with with rewriting an extensive and complex billing system, Hipps and his mostly engineering-trained colleagues often struggled to trace the convoluted logic of the existing program, discovering that, as in a great novel, every narrative thread of code was attached to other threads and that pulling on one threatened to unravel the rest. It took a new hire with a background in music, Hipps explains, to discover how to navigate the complexity of the system, drawing upon her training as a pianist to follow intricate patterns and themes through a musical piece.  Hipps explains why, therefore, humanities training can't be an afterthought or a ""plugin,"" added onto an education only after the technical intricacies of STEM have been mastered. In fact, it makes far more sense, he suggests, to begin with the liberal arts, providing students with a solid grounding in problem solving, creative thinking, and critical thinking.  Beyond my appreciation of Hipps appreciation for the fundamental importance of the liberal arts, I was drawn to the piece immediately by his reference to early 19th-century author and feminist, Virginia Woolf. When we launched Domain of One's Own four years ago, we were aiming at providing student and faculty with their own domain names and open-source Web hosting. The title of the project is, of course, cribbed from Woolf's 1929 text, ""A Room of One's Own,"" which we have been recently revisiting in relationship to the DoOO project as it grows and expands.  In that extended essay, Woolf builds an argument for why women need space (literal and figurative) of their own in order to explore their potential as writers. Domain of One's Own operates on the assumption that within an academic community in 2016 we need new kinds of spaces in order to explore our potential as citizens of the increasingly digital world we live in. Our own domains allow us to name and place ourselves within the larger landscape of the Web, a landscape that every day seems to dominate a new aspect of our modern lives. Open-source Web hosting allows us to instantiate ourselves within these domains, unshackled from the private, proprietary, and corporate spaces that tend to overwhelm our online experiences.  Given the name of our project and UMW's status as a small, liberal arts college, Hipps' juxtaposition of the realities of the field of programming with the words and ideas of Virginia Woolf seemed, frankly, serendipitous  ?  even if Woolf serves as little more than a symbol in his title and a minor reference in his piece. His argument, more importantly, does undergird many of the values of Domain of One's Own, and perhaps our project even extends his argument in a new direction: must we choose between STEM and humanities from the onset? Is it possible to imagine spaces, experiences, and opportunities for our students to wed the praxis of coding with the philosophies of the humanities?  I would argue that Domain of One's Own extends Hipps argument even further. Yes, we need to figure out how to prepare a generation of students to appreciate music and code, whether they become pianists or programmers, because these two fields are more tightly woven than we often imagine. But we also must train our coders as humanists because code is never without an ethic or an agenda. As digital spaces increasingly become the platforms upon which we live our lives, we must teach students to understand that those platforms are coded spaces, built by humans with business goals, political opinions, and complex identities. There is nothing agnostic about Facebook, We the People, or Amazon. Each of them, and every other digital space we inhabit, inflicts values upon us. In the future, the world we live in will be increasingly shaped by how those values are encoded and who chooses what those values should be. Who is better able to navigate this complex landscape of technology, culture, and humanity than the liberal arts major?

I'm actually copy/pasting my comment from there. Thanks for your great work Martha and others here at UMW, you allow us to stand on the shoulders of giants.  I believe that it is crucial that I train my (mostly) engineering students to express themselves on their own blogs and via social media as well as listen to the voices of others.  Funny thing is after doing this for a couple of years, I find it normal. Other teachers are looking at me like I am from another planet; well, that is true since I'm from Canada and live in M?xico. :)  Reply  M le Comte  August 19th 2016, 12:56 pm  As a recent grad working in the tech world, as an English major no less, I feel like professors have a responsibility to encourage students to figure out what they want from their degrees. It's na¥ve to assume students are in school solely for the pursuit of knowledge. Higher education is one of the very few avenues a person can take after school in the pursuit of a career that provides some personal fulfilment as well as a steady living income. Long gone are the days where any ole undergraduate degree can get someone a decent paying job, and I feel like that's honestly what many students want.  I realize this presupposes the idea that a college degree should translate into a job, and that premise alone is subject to scrutiny. For many students however, securing employment upon graduating is paramount if not a downright necessity (depending upon how they were able to afford tuition). Yes, students can go to graduate school to further specialize their skills once they get a general ""well-rounded education"" at a liberal arts university. But at what price? How long will it take to pay back the loans? How might that affect someone's position to start a family? The current costs of preschool alone rival that of in-state tuition at a public university. I'mƒgetting off topic.  Sure ? everyone's experience is going to be different. In my experience, if a person is going to school to secure a ""good"" job, then liberal arts should come second. Critical thinking and creative problem solving alone, while essential skills in any workplace, do not translate to employment. It isn't impossible to get one of these ""good"" jobs with a humanities degree, but it makes it more challenging. I was always told to study what interested me in undergrad; this would show employers I could be trained. Unfortunately most employers don't want to waste time training anymore. They want candidates to already have quantifiable qualifications and experience. Postings for entry level position in almost any field, save maybe sales, require 1 to 3 years of experience.  I think what I'm trying to say is that students should know liberal arts will not be enough. Major in STEM and minor in the arts. At a liberal arts school like UMW, there are still plenty of other required credits they have to pay for that will leave them with ""a well-rounded education."" A STEM background will afford them the leisure of time spent on things other than the filling out of endless job applications, and a minor gives them a jumping off point for a true passion.  I don't regret my English degree for many reasons. Although sometimes it feels like I could have just gone to the library.

"Pete Rorabaugh,Domain of One's Own: Research,http://peterorabaugh.org/domain-2/domain-of-ones-own-research/,8/19/2016,"(Pictured above: David Morgen at the Atlanta Regional DoOO Incubator, April 2014)  How long has it been since you've been an email chain that you'd call ""exciting""? I had one yesterday.  I received a course release to compose and publish an article on the pedagogical and administrative methodologies of faculty using Domain of One's Own-inspired work in their classes and/or programs. So, yesterday I sent an email to a bunch of colleagues (and people who don't me, but whose work I have been admiring from afar) to solicit their interest and availability in my research project for this semester.  I've been working in/around DoOO for three years. When I found the community  ?  and community is the central concept for DoOO (thanks David, Jim, and Tim)  ?  it was a provided the perfect extension of new media literacies work that I'd started building into my classes at Georgia Tech and Georgia State. Since that time, I helped organize the Domain of One's Own Incubator in Atlanta, coordinated and led the Domain Pilot in my former department, and consulted with faculty interested in self-hosted domain pedagogy in other departments around Atlanta.  Because of the DoOO community's bootstrap, DIY ethic, it has evolved organically and locally. Domain work isn't particular to a tool nor does it use a set of prescribed guidelines. Instead it's a methodology, an ""way of seeing"" teaching, learning, and digital citizenship that I've always found consistent with my own foundation in critical pedagogy.  However, I see that the community needs some research support  ?  more engaged scholarship in documenting its growth, history, application, principles (broadly defined), pedagogy, and administration. My work this semester will drill into those last two.  The responses to my initial ""call"" yesterday were encouraging and rich. I received overwhelming interest in helping me with my project. I'll be scheduling a series of phone and video interviews over the next several weeks to gather resources, examples, and history on how self-hosted domains are operating around the country (and, perhaps, the world). I'll be paying particular attention to the kinds of assignments that faculty find most useful and the successes and challenges that domain-centered approaches present to larger administrative units (departments, programs, and universities).  I'm certainly not confining my research net to this initial email recipients. If you're playing with self-hosted domains, an experienced user at Reclaim Hosting, or even just considering tinkering with this kind of curricular initiative, please reply below. I'll also be setting up a Slack channel in which to organize my work and encourage conversation between members of the DoOO community; let me know if you'd like to be included.  "Maha Bali,I Don't Own My Domain : I Rent It #DoOO,http://blog.mahabali.me/blog/educational-technology-2/i-dont-own-my-domain-i-rent-it-dooo/,8/23/2016,"Reading Time: 1 minutes  I don't know why we say ""domain of one's own"" and ""reclaim your domain"". It's not very accurate.  My understanding of ownership is that something belongs to me. That I have already acquired it or been gifted it. And I own it until I die, no additional payment required. If I own it and I die, it passes to my heirs.  That isn't at all the case with domains.  When I created a domain, it didn't become mine. Basically    1. I don't own the domain name. I pay for it every year. That looks like rent   2. I don't own the actual hosting. I pay Reclaim (whom I love and trust) for shared hosting because I assume they will do a better job of the hardware/backup etc  And here is my question for #DoOO for students. It is great for a university to offer students a domain of their own. But once they graduateƒ They have to pay for it themselves. In Egypt many young people don't have access to a credit card (even the ones at my elite institution). They would lose it after the few months grace period. What a shame, right?  Of course if the students kept their blog on WordPress and WordPress closed down they would lose it, also. So there's that.  And they regularly lose the work they did on their LMS. Soƒthat too.  Any thoughts on this?  Update: read comment thread below  Also: linking to a recent/old (haha) Prof Hacker post of mine on digital life after death (which mentions some of the stuff Audrey alludes to as post- ownership society)  Update again: I annotated Audrey's post  https://via.hypothes.is/hackeducation.com/2016/08/23/domains  ### Share this:     Email    Twitter    Facebook    Google    More       Pinterest    Tumblr       Pocket    LinkedIn       Print    Reddit       ### Like this:  Like Loading...  ### Related  Categories: Educational Technology | Tags: #DoOo | Permalink  "Audrey Watters,A Domain of One's Own in a Post-Ownership Society,http://hackeducation.com/2016/08/23/domains,8/23/2016,"read  Maha Bali has written a blog post asking why we talk about ""a domain of one's own"" and ""reclaim your domain"" since people never really own their domains. They merely rent them, she points out.  > My understanding of ownership is that something belongs to me. That I have already acquired it or been gifted it. And I own it until I die, no additional payment required. If I own it and I die, it passes to my heirs.  It's a fair point. One pays a fee for the right to register (and renew) a domain name for a website; one likely also pays a fee to a company that hosts the files for that website so that it is accessible over the network. One pays a fee to access the network. These fees must all be paid monthly or annually to maintain access and functionality.  The ""domain of one's own"" isn't owned; it's leased, Maha contends. But when one controls ? albeit temporarily ? a domain name and a bit of server space, I contend, we act in resistance to an Internet culture and an Internet technology and an Internet business model in which we control little to nothing. We own little to nothing.  Increasingly, we work for free for major Internet technology companies, on their platforms. We post our photos, our status updates, our articles, our discussions. We share, we like, and we retweet. Our content and our data, shared publicly, become theirs to profit from.  Shared in public, none of this is public in terms of ownership, let's be clear; this is almost entirely private infrastructure. Thus, our rights are always already limited; and any notion of ""ownership"" that we might have based on physical property does not necessarily extend to the digital.  Nonetheless I don't think that the Domain of One's Own initiative is mislabeled, as Maha implies in her post.  I want to dig a little deeper into both the etymology of the phrase ""domain of one's own,"" the meaning of the words ""own"" and ""ownership,"" and the legalities and practicalities of the latter in particular in a digital world.  ### A student must have a domain of her own if she is to write...  The University of Mary Washington's initiative, ""Domain of One's Own,"" is phrased thusly as a nod to Virginia Woolf's essay ""A Room of One's Own,"" in which she famously quipped that ""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" We can critique ? and certainly we should ? the class implications and expectations in Woolf's commandment here; and we must consider both the financial burden and the transaction mechanism of a push for domains in education ? as Maha notes, for example, many students in Egypt don't have a credit card with which to make online purchases.  ""Give her a room of her own and five hundred a year, let her speak her mind and leave out half that she now puts in, and she will write a better book one of these days,"" Woolf wrote in 1929. (That 500 quid is the equivalent to about $37,000 when adjusted for inflation.) But Woolf is not simply talking about having a piece of paper ? a title, for example ? that decrees she owns the room. It's about having the financial freedom and a personal space to write.  To own is to possess. To own is to have authority and control. To own is to acknowledge. It implies a responsibility. Ownership is a legal designation; but it's something more than that too. It's something more and then, without legal protection, the word also means something less.  University of Mary Washington professor Debra Schleef recently wrote about a Domain of One's Own Book Club at UMW, making explicit the connections between Woolf and the domains initiative at the school and asking,  > What does it mean, both literally and figuratively, to have a room of one's own? Woolf's room with a lock, and resources (the famous ""500 pounds a year,"" but also education, time, and access) provides a place within which the figurative can flower. Similarly, a domain is more than a delimited internet space with your name on it ? it is a figurative room that provides time, creative license, and a space to express oneself freely. Part of our discussion revolved around what people are most lacking that prevents them from fully using their domains. The time and space to write? Or is it something deeper than that ? the need for a place to write and create without fear?  ### Ownership in a Subscription Economy  What does it mean to ""own"" a digital good ? a domain name or otherwise? This strikes me as an incredibly important question for society (for students) to wrestle with, and it's a question that is made explicit through the Domain of One's Own initiative.  > .@mburtis's vision for Domain of One's Own (and why i say it's the most important ed-tech we have) #digped pic.twitter.com/KbHu8PZnCb  >  >  ?  Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) August 12, 2016  What do you own? Your degree? Your ideas? Your work? Are you sure? Have you read the fine print of the Terms of Service?  What data and/or content can you take with you when you finish a class or when you graduate? And what can you, as Maha frames it, pass along to your heirs when you die?  Of course, we might ask how these questions ? all questions ? about ownership are already shaped by the government and by banks, both of whom can readily seize the materials items in our possession. Then too, how are these questions reshaped by new technologies? Are we already predisposed to expect such seizures?  When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question ""what do you own"" is probably ""not much."" You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you've purchased a license to access the content. Your heirs will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream; you've paid for a subscription. Your heirs will not inherit your digital music library. You don't own the movies you watch via Netflix; again, it's a subscription and unlike a print magazine subscription, once you stop paying the bill, you won't have stacks of old copies lying about. If you're using proprietary file formats for your data or there are DRM restrictions on your content, it's quite likely your heirs will be unable to open the files to even look at what they contain so as to judge if any of your bits and bytes are worth saving. You (likely) do not own the software you use (unless it's open source); it's been licensed to you. Similarly, you (likely) do not own the operating system that powers your computer; you've paid for a license there as well. And increasingly, there are restrictions with what you can do with the computer hardware as well as the software that you might think is yours because it is in your possession ? but as Cory Doctorow argues, ""If you can't open it, you don't own it.""  How do we resist this? (And resist this, I contend, we must.) How do we help people understand the fragility of their digital data, the gnawing away at ownership and at (individual and collective) memory and at individual and institutional legacy that the ""Silicon Valley narrative"" tends to exalt?  In part, I think we resist through education; we help students and scholars understand how new digital technologies work, how these technologies shape and reshape and are shaped by culture, politics, money, and law.  In part. In part.  ### The False Promises of an ""Ownership Society""  President George W. Bush once exulted an ""ownership society,"" a promise for all Americans, he said. I think we know such a thing as an ""ownership society"" has never existed for all of us. Nor has, to be fair, the ability to have ""a room of one's own."" But Bush made this phrase ? ""ownership society,"" ? a cornerstone of his policies circa 2003?4 as he cut taxes. Americans would and could and should own their own house, he argued. They would and could and should be responsible for their own medical insurance. They would and could and should be responsible for their retirement savings. They would and could and should have to pay for their own education.  The cornerstone of an ""ownership society"" is privatization. The cornerstone is a dismantling of public infrastructure. Costs and risks are thus transferred to the individual.  And now, we're told ? after all the subprime mortgage crisis, the student loan debt crisis and on and on and on ? we have moved to a ""post-ownership society."" It's all still heavily privatized, but now you own nothing. You just rent. You just borrow. You just subscribe. You just share. You owe, not own. You work, but part-time. You work, but freelance. Everything is contingent; all aspects of life, now precarious. But you're freeƒ You're free from owning.  So yes, it's certainly worth asking: does ""Domain of One's Own"" transfer costs and risks ? as both the ownership and the post-ownership society would like to sell us on ? to the individual? I'm not so sure it does, or at least that it does in the same way as Bush's vision of an ""ownership society"". It seems, rather, that the rest of ed-tech ? the LMS, adaptive learning software, predictive analytics, surveillance tech through and through ? is built on an ideology of data extraction, outsourcing, and neoliberalism. But the Web ? and here I mean the Web as an ideal, to be sure, and less the Web in reality ? has a stake in public scholarship and public infrastructure. Indeed, I'd contend that many of the educational technologies that schools have chosen to adopt in lieu of the Web, in lieu of projects like Domain of One's Own, help further this Uber-ification of education, in which everything we do now is trackable, extractable, and monetizable by other platforms, by private, for- profit companies.  How do we resist this? (And resist this, I contend, we must.) We resist through education. Yes. But we also must resist at the level of structure, at the level of systems, at the level of infrastructure. We can challenge how the Web and the Internet work ? at the level of politics, power, money, and technology. But we can do so only if we understand what's at stake, if we understand that the Web and the Internet are not naturally-occurring entities but are corporate and national forces bending towards certain ideological ends ? privatization and profit.  ""A Domain of One's Own,"" which operates at the level of infrastructure, at the level of literary analysis, at the level of literacy, at the level of feminism (a flawed feminism, to be sure, with its early twentieth century British heritage) and at the level of technology (a flawed technology, to be sure, with its imperialist, militarist heritage) is just one way for us to build forward, to build better public practices around scholarship. I'm not sure that ""ownership"" is the wedge I want to use to argue for this project; but I am certain that ""post-ownership,"" where we all just ""share"" and ""rent"" on the powerful platforms of Silicon Valley billionaires, is far from a satisfactory alternative. When I call for each of us to have a domain of our own, I'm not really invoking ""ownership"" in the way in which Maha suggests the ""Domain of One's Own"" initiative implies; but I am, I do confess, invoking Virginia Woolf and the importance having the space and safety and security (financially well before technologically) to think and write and be.  "Parrish Waters,Vision and Change at UMW,http://umwdtlt.com/vision-and-change-at-umw/,8/23/2016,"# Vision and Change at UMW  August 23, 2016  |In Digital Liberal Arts, Domain of One's Own  |By Parrish Waters  The modern classroom has evolved to become a much more interactive environment. This entails moving away from the one-way communication technique of pure lecture, in favor alternative methods such as a ïflipped' classroom. While this movement does not mean completely eliminating in class lectures, it does mean to incorporate an ever increasing amount of active learning techniques into our classroom time. The goal is to better engage our students through individual and group activities that include worksheets, tangible manipulative exercises, and oral questioning and spontaneous polls that better convey the material in the classroom. These methods are far more effective at relaying complex ideas and materials than the traditional lecture, and also result in a much better retention of the knowledge. These efforts are in alignment with the national initiative, overseen by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), termed the ""Vision and Change Initiative"".  To support this transition in the UMW Biology Department, we are creating a website through the Domain of One's Own program that will provide information on active learning strategies, and will serve as a repository of active learning exercises for our faculty to use in their classroom. In this venture, we have relied heavily on the faculty and staff of DTLT, CTE&I and DKC, who have all played an integral part in shaping the philosophy behind our ideas, and in constructing our website repository.  Currently, our website describes the motivation behind our transition to a more active learning environment, defines multiple established active pedagogical philosophies that we utilize, and contains sets of active learning exercises for our introductory biology courses.  In the future, our website will be expanded to include a more comprehensive list of active learning pedagogy tools, and will also incorporate a greater variety of active learning exercises to be used throughout our curriculum. Furthermore, the website may incorporate an open forum for faculty (within and beyond our department) to submit and retrieve active pedagogy exercises for their classroom, as well as a process for students to comment and provide feedback on individual activities and pedagogy tools. Our hope is that this website will serve as a professional development tool for new faculty and a continuing education resource to introduce and extend the knowledge of our current faculty on the benefits of active learning.  Parrish Waters is an Assistant Professor with the UMW Biology Department, and teaches courses in Human Anatomy and Human Physiology.

"none,College of Arts and Letters,http://www.cal.msu.edu/news/webhostingservice?utm_content=buffer02700&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer,8/30/2016,"#  Investing in Online Scholarly Presence  August 30, 2016  In today's fast-paced world where the Internet is the go-to research tool and information on any topic is just a click or tap away, one's own digital presence is more important than ever. The College of Arts & Letters recognizes this, and starting this month, will offer all its graduate students and faculty a new kind of web hosting support.  The College signed a contract with Reclaim Hosting to provide its graduate students and faculty with a full commercial web hosting package and domains that they control in order to build online spaces for professional portfolios, digital projects, and more. The College of Arts & Letters is the first at MSU to offer this type of service.  ""We've been working with our faculty and graduate students to think strategically about how best to build community around their scholarship by making sure their work is accessible to a broad public,"" said Christopher P. Long, Dean of the College of Arts & Letters. ""This is really just an extension of the land-grant mission to make knowledge accessible. But it's also an opportunity to think strategically about how our work is presented and received so that it has the broadest impact possible.  ""What we realized early on is that students and faculty need a domain of their own, an online space they control to curate and present their work in ways that are consistent with the values and commitments of their research. Reclaim Hosting made it possible for us to offer all of our graduate students and faculty, whoever wants it, just such a place to create a dynamic online presence designed to ensure their work is more widely read and potentially more widely cited.""  ### Service Offered for Free  The College is offering graduate students and faculty this service for free for the duration of their careers with the College. For graduate students, the College also will offer this service for a year following graduation to assist them in the placement process. Then if they choose to continue with the service a year following graduation, Reclaim Hosting will move them to paid hosting. Likewise, faculty too can move their service or transition to paid hosting.  ""This will make it possible for any graduate student who recognizes the importance of having a web presence to afford it. This resource will give our students a leg up on the competition when it comes to placement,"" said Scott Schopieray, Assistant Dean of Technology and Innovation. ""As for faculty, a lot of them recognize that it's important to have a web presence, but don't know where to start. This provides a nice entry point for them.""  The College of Arts & Letters previously offered web hosting services, but with limited functionality.  ""We weren't providing 21st century web hosting,"" Schopieray said. ""All they could use was basic html. They couldn't use databases, scripting, or install open-source products, none of that.""  For those graduate students and faculty interested in the Reclaim Hosting service, they should complete and submit the online form. They then will be given a brand-standard template for free. And as long as they don't modify the template, the College will support it and provide new versions of the template as it's updated.  ""The hosting service is pretty easy to use once they get their head around it,"" Schopieray said. ""We will help them learn to build their sites in a way where it makes sense to them so they will remember what they are doing, and they can use any open source platform for content management based on what they are comfortable with.""  ### Workshops Available  Throughout the year, workshops will be offered (two per month) to serve as an introduction to the web hosting service and to help graduate students and faculty prepare a robust and curated web presence that will enhance their reputation as scholars and advance the mission of the College and University.  The workshops cover:     Setting up a Reclaim Hosting account    Developing a basic online presence    Planning your path to leadership in your field    Downloading academic profile information    Advanced Wordpress use and hosting, including plugins and themes for Wordpress    Communication strategies and using social media to promote your work  So far, three workshops have been held with more than 90 faculty and graduate students attending. Online training materials also are being developed for people unable to attend the workshops.  The College of Arts & Letters is now partnering on this endeavor with leadership from the College of Natural Science, College of Education, Lyman Briggs College, the HUB, the Graduate School, and MSU's Academic Advancement Network.  "Jim Groom,Putting Domains Infrastructure in the Cloud,http://bavatuesdays.com/putting-domains-infrastructure-in-the-cloud/,8/30/2016,"This semester we having been moving our Domain of One's Own (DoOO) packages for new institutions to Digital Ocean. Up and until now we haven't run DoOO through cloud infrastructure providers like AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean, etc. for two reasons: price and storage. It has been cheaper for us to run these packages off a larger dedicated server that we could virtualize and partition into 4 or 5 institutional setups. But ever as the financial differences were becoming nominal, the storage constraints on servers at Linode and Digital Ocean made it impossible. We offer 250 GBs as part of our DoOO package, but most comparably specced servers through Linode or Digital Ocean had 100 GB of storage max.  Recently Digital Ocean announced Block Storage which essentially enabled us to run a server with 60 GB storage and mount another 250 GB SSD drive. Fast, cheap storage to accompany there server made the idea of running a Domains package on Digital Ocean feasible this Fall, so we did it. There are a couple of beautiful things about this development for Reclaim Hosting. First, if a school needs more storage or CPU power we can manage than almost immediately with the click of a button. When we had BYU creeping up on storage and CPU capacity limits we had to move them off our virtual server to dedicated machines, this meant a physical migration of accounts ? that would no longer be the case.  Second, Digital Ocean has data centers all over the world, and we can now offer DoOO packages to schools in data centers physically within Canada, the UK, the EU, and Asia. This is particularly important for schools in Canada, the UK, and the EU who need to comply with stricter regulations around data security and privacy ? a process I've been learning a bit about this Summer. Who knows, we may even get a school from the UK or Europe running a Domains pilot sometime soon [fingers crossed]. As for Asia, not sure given there hasn't been any serious interest in Domains infrastructure for schools there just yet, but we've already been using a Sydney-based AWS data center to host infrastructure for Charles Sturt University in Australia.  It remains fascinating and truly exciting for me how much simpler managing and scaling ed-tech infrastructure has become through services like Digital Ocean, I would love to find out if and how edtech groups are using these services for smaller projects. Phil Hill's article about the quiet move to AWS for enterprise LMSs is a good one, but I would love to learn more about the one- off, marginal uses.  "Kris Shaffer,Clone This Website! ? Introducing Peasy,http://umwdtlt.com/clone-this-websiteintroducing-peasy/,9/1/2016,"# Clone This Website! ? Introducing Peasy  September 1, 2016  |In Domain of One's Own, Open Education, Tools  |By Kris Shaffer  Want to build a website but find a blank canvas intimidating? Found a great ""open"" resource that's legal, but really difficult, to copy? Have a new Domain of Your Own but don't know how to get started?  For the past few weeks, I've been working on a new web app called Peasy (as in ""easy peasy""). Peasy is relatively easy-to-install and easy-to-use platform for building simple websites. There is no ""back-end"" to fuss with, no database to administer, just a simple web site that you can edit live while you're logged in.  But the aspect of Peasy that I'm most excited about is that it makes it really easy to clone existing web sites, if they're also built in Peasy. That means that you never have to start from scratch. You can find a site you like ? such a syllabus, an ""about me"" page, a CV, a course website, an online textbookƒ ? and with just a couple clicks, you can clone that entire site and make your own copy of it. Your focus, then, is not re-building existing work, but building on that work, extending it in new ways. And since all Peasy sites are easily copyable, remixable, and given an open-source license by default, Peasy makes it easy for others to build on your work, too.  In an article for Hybrid Pedagogy a few years ago, I wrote  > Scholars and pedagogues are not merely consumers (of journals, of textbooks, of ed-tech tools, of old scholars). Scholars and pedagogues are not merely creators (of journals, of textbooks, of ed-tech tools, of new scholars). Scholars are creator/consumers, developer/usersƒ hackers.  >  > ƒ  >  > We are unapologetic tinkerers who neither invent the wheel, nor are satisfied with the wheels already at our disposal.  Peasy is built with this philosophy in mind. As scholars and teachers (and, I'd argue, students), our role is neither to create and broadcast, nor to consume passively. Our role is to engage critically with what exists, to extend it, build on it, break it. With Peasy, I'm hoping it will be easier to do exactly that.  Peasy is still at an early stage in its development. But you can download it, install it, tinker, play, build, break, and even contribute to the development! I'd love to get feedback (and even code!) from others who try it out, so I can continue to fix bugs and add capabilities. (As a young project, Peasy still has some kinks to work out. Please backup anything you build! :) )  And if you just want to see it in action, check out these sample sites:     Peasy ? open by default    Digital Storytelling (DS106), a course website    Computational Music Analysis ? a single-page site with a course syllabus    Music Notes ? an open-source mini textbook    Digital Pedagogy Lab Praxis ? Lee Skallerup Bessette's home page for her track at the Digital Pedagogy Lab 2016 Institute  Let me know what you think! And if you build a site you'd like to share, I'd love to add it to the list of examples for people to visit ? and clone!

Below is the text of her talk; the audio above is edited from the video recording of that morning's keynotes.      I thought I'd start today by telling you a little bit about myself. While some of your faces are familiar, I don't know most of you, and I doubt you know much about me.  I trust you know my name, and you now know from my introduction that I run the Digital Knowledge Center at the University of Mary Washington, which provides peer tutoring and consulting to our students working on digital projects and assignments. Here are a few other things I'd like to tell you about myself.  I attended this school (although at the time it was known as Mary Washington College), and I graduated from here 20 years ago this past May. I received a B.A. in English, and when I graduated I was dead set on going to graduate school, studying early modern British literature, getting a PhD, and, hopefully, eventually, teaching at a school just like this.  Instead, a couple of other things happened. The year I graduated from MWC was pretty close to the year the Web ""broke big."" I discovered the Web between my junior and senior years in college (in a summer medieval literature course, of all places), and my primary use of it that following year was as a research tool for policy debate (I was on the debate team). By the time I graduated, I had been thoroughly charmed.  What I actually ended up doing in the year after I graduated was going to work at one of the finest places in the world: the Folger Shakespeare Library as a program assistant for the Folger Institute which organizes and runs seminars, workshops, and summer institutes for faculty and postdocs in early modern studies.  I spent a lot of time around mid- to late-career scholars who were fully and meaningfully employed in teaching and research positions and a lot of time around struggling graduate students who were working construction to make ends meet. And I was lucky enough in my job to be able to start doing stuff with the Web. The confluence of those two things  ?  falling in love with the Web while falling out of love with the idea of never getting the job I wanted  ?  took me down a different path. I ended up getting a masters degree in instructional technology from Teachers College at Columbia University.  I moved back to Virginia, and a few months after completing my thesis project and getting my degree I got a job  ?  right back here at Mary Washington.  I was hired as an instructional technology liaison, and I worked up the hill a bit from this building supporting faculty in fine and performing arts. It was 2001, and I loved the faculty and the students, but I hated my job. At that time, I was basically providing technical support for faculty and their departments: fixing printers, setting up lab computers, and, occasionally, teaching someone something about Word or Powerpoint or Excel.  We had one tool in our instructional technology tool shed at that time: Blackboard. And faculty primarily seemed to use it to distribute digital files, email students, and post grades.  So that was my first full-time professional job in instructional technology. I wasn't using anything that had to do with my degree. My boss at the time suggested that for professional development I consider becoming an Apple Certified Technician (this was pre-Genius days).  I did work with great people in my department, and, like I said, I loved the faculty and students and I loved, and still do love, this place.  I would like to say that lots of faculty were coming to me for help thinking through how they could use the Web to transform their classes, their teaching, and their students' experiences  ?  and that I was regularly inundated with bold, imaginative ideas and that I was capable and empowered enough to partner with them on these adventures. But I felt neither capable nor empowered, and the truth is, neither were they.  When I was working at the Folger and in graduate school in the late 90s the Web seemed like a place of infinite possibility, a great democratizing force, and a space in which anyone could build themselves something remarkable. Now, I was younger then, and I was, of course, naive. And the history of the Web is more complex than that, and technology nostalgia is like any other nostalgia  ?  colored and softened by the long lens of the future.  But I do remember, for example, a tool that I played with in graduate school (this would have been spring of 2000) that allowed multiple people to leave public annotations on a Web site. And when I used it, I felt like I was connecting with people in a way that had never been done before. It felt like magic. And it didn't work that well. The truth is bandwidth and code hadn't caught up with our imaginations. But the Web was this powerful force that was washing over us, and we were all  ?  in every field, in every industry, in personal and professional domains  ?  trying to stay afloat and figure out what it meant.  It seems only reasonable to assume. No, not reasonable. It seems impossible to not assume that in the domain of education, a domain that is entirely about the creating, the building, the sharing of knowledge and learning that this new force of creation and knowledge sharing would be fully and authentically realized.  How on earth could it not be?  How could we all not see the power that this new medium was affording us and not be drawn to it, in every way?  Most importantly, how could we not, in fact, see it as our job to shape this new medium and to help the rest of the world understand what it could do? As a platform for transformational teaching? As a space for public research and dissemination of knowledge? As a place for collaboration on scales never seen before?  And yet. Blackboard.  What happened?  I have a few theories.  I think the Web hit us at a critical moment in higher education where we were already struggling with doing our work less like schools and more like businesses, and the tech industry and its vendors had already begun to infiltrate us with promises of how technology could help us achieve this goal. We had already bought into student information systems (which eventually became everything information systems), and with the promise of those systems came the promise of lots of data which would allow us to become more efficient and streamlined.  The first LMSs were actually built at schools, often under the guidance of faculty. I like to imagine that those people were as charmed as I was about the affordances of the Web for teaching and learning. I want to believe their intentions were very good, but what they focused their efforts on was building systems for disseminating content. Systems with common interfaces. Systems with standard tools. Systems that could integrate with other systems to make our work more efficient, our experiences cleaner, and our teaching and learning, as a result, more sterile.  What if the early Web adopters in higher education had imagined Domain of One's Own instead of Course in a Box? Why didn't they?  In part this question is about why our systems use courses as a unit of measure instead of people. And the answer to that is really complex and stretches far back into the history of education, which is beyond the scope of my 25 minute co-keynote. But, suffice it to say, courses have long been the way we have measured our institutions and the way we have organized our administrative processes. We understand ourselves and what we offer to students through the unit of the course. But I would argue that with the greater adoption of administrative systems in higher education we doubled-down on that unit of measure. And with the LMS we did something even bigger.  Because even if we had decided for centuries that in our schools the course would be how we'd standardize administration of our schools, we didn't, systematically, believe that courses themselves were standardized. We valued the notion that within one professor's course she had the freedom to enact and explore the topic at hand using the pedagogies of her own choosing. And, by extension, presumably the tools and technologies of her own choosing.  But when the LMS goes beyond merely providing administrative and management features and instead is offering features designed (perhaps badly) to build community, share information, and collaborate with others, it is obviously influencing pedagogy.  I don't think we acknowledge this nearly enough when we talk about the technologies we use in education. We like to think that a tool is easily defined by its basic functionality: discussion board, wiki page, synchronous chat, quiz builder. But all of these tools are of course far more complex than that. They've been designed and coded and engineered by companies to provide functionality in particular ways. And that design and code guides our students' and our experiences through their use.  Imagine, if you will, if someone told you that from now on when you conduct a discussion in your classroom you are bound by a series of rules, procedures, and steps. You must follow those at all times, and, everyone else at your institution must also. From now on, every classroom discussion at your school must be conducted using these sames rules, procedures, and steps. If you don't like them? You'll have to wait and see if the next update to them addresses your concerns. You would probably balk at this suggestion  ?  and you should. But rules, procedures, and steps are exactly what code defines, and when we fail to acknowledge this we fail to see the pedagogical power that technology and the LMS can have in our classroom.  So the LMS underscores and further codifies a set of beliefs and values: courses should be used as a unit of measure to more efficiently track and administer the business of higher education, and within those courses we should build standard interfaces, provide standardized features and tools, and promote, among our students, the expectation that their experiences from one course to the next will be, well, standard.  Why else did we end up with courses in boxes instead of domains of one's own?  There are actually some pretty good practical reasons why DoOO didn't exist in 1996. Domains cost a bundle back then, and procuring them wasn't straight forward. But lots of schools had what we now affectionately refer to as tilde spaces.  Why didn't we end up with a tilde space of one's own?  Well, we actually did. Many schools, including this one, University of Mary Washington, provided students with their own tilde space where they could post HTML documents. And some faculty did use those spaces for students to publish on the Web. But as the Web evolved our institutions didn't keep up with evolving those spaces. We didn't add scripting or database features, and so the spaces became technically irrelevant and obsolete. And instead of putting our resources and skills into imagining what those spaces could become for teaching and learning, we began spending a lot of money on learning managements systems and other educational technologies.  So now we have a perfect storm. We've doubled-down on courses and the LMS, we've bought into the notion that what technology afforded us for teaching and learning was standardization of experience and pedagogy, and we've abandoned the nascent spaces that might have let us continue to explore the Web as a flexible, open, and powerful platform for teaching and learning.  And we've spent so many years going down this path that there are now powerful monetary investments and administrative processes and expectations pounding on our backs, pushing us further and further.  How do we make it stop?  To answer that question, I need to pick up my story. So after working at Mary Washington for about 16 months, I got married and moved out west to Montana for a few years (my husband was in graduate school there). When we decided it was time to move back east, I discovered that my old job, which had been frozen for budgetary reasons right after I moved, had just been reposted.  I applied, got the position, and in August of 2004 I moved back to Fredericksburg, into the exact same office I had vacated two years before. It was the same job but not at all. A lot had changed at Mary Washington. We were a university now and my department was under new leadership, In that first year I was back my department began experimenting with open source platforms. During that time, every member of my department (the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies or DTLT) got a domain name and open source Web hosting. We went from having one tool in the toolshed to many, many tools from which we could choose.  The tools themselves were open source applications  ?  applications for creating Web sites in many different flavors: blogs, discussion forums, media galleries, wikis, even open source learning management systems.  In addition, we were working in a space where, if we wanted to, we could learn to build our own tools, or at the very least we could adapt the tools we had.  Suddenly, the Web felt accessible to me in a way it had never been before. I had complete control over a slice of it, and I dove into understanding how it worked. I started my own blog (as did all of my colleagues). I began experimenting with open source community building platforms as a way to connect our department since, at the time, we all worked in different buildings. We began building custom learning spaces for courses, based on partnerships with faculty.  For me, working in open source made possible all the things I had imagined back in the 90s, and it challenged all of those beliefs and values that the LMS underscored. It was possible to build learning environments that empowered students, and not necessarily to the detriment of the course. I could create learning environments in which the interfaces, tools, and features were customized to the needs of the professor and students. And there was simply no reason to assume that the experience from one course to the next needed to be standardized. Open source was infused with a different set of values and beliefs: co-construction, iteration, fast prototyping, extensibility, and, well, openness.  It was probably within three years that we began to ask the question ""What if every faculty member and student had this? Their own domain name? Their own Web space to build what they want or need? What would happen and what would change?""  It took another six years before Domain of One's Own was fully realized at UMW. During that six years though, we continued to build and experiment.  The first great experiment was UMW Blogs, our institutional blogging system which debuted in fall of 2007. In that nine years, it has had almost 13,000 users and it now contains 11,000 individual WordPress sites.  What exactly is UMW Blogs? Well, first and foremost it is WordPress, but a special flavor of WordPress. Specifically it's WordPress MultiSite which allows us to administer a single core code instance that governs as many individual sites as we need. In other words, we only have to upgrade it in one place.  Within that system we can then make plugins and themes available to users. Themes let users change the way their site looks; plugins let them change the way it behaves. This extensibility of WordPress is why it has become, for me, a game-changer. When faculty or students have something they want to build on the Web, I can almost always figure out a way they can achieve it with WordPress.  Students have used UMW Blogs to create literary journals, survey properties around Fredericksburg, build online exhibits, connect with the authors of the works their reading, publish their poetry, develop in-depth online resources, and, of course, blog.  UMW Blogs allows us to give any member of the UMW community a WordPress site  ?  really as many WordPress sites as they want, but we still control the underlying code. We decide what plugins and themes are available, and we're the ones controlling when upgrades happen.  In 2011, I became part of another project that pushed our thinking even further. That spring, I was scheduled to teach a computer science class in digital storytelling alongside Jim Groom. Jim had taught the class face-to- face for two semesters, but he wanted to do something bigger that spring. He suggested we open the course up and allow anyone on the Web to participate. I gamely agreed.  Let me back up. I have to tell you something else. That section of CPSC 106 that I taught in spring 2011 was the first time I had ever taught. After years of working as an instructional technologist and Web developer at schools, I had finally gotten up the guts to teach. And, of course, the first time out of the gate, I was teaching it with Jim Groom on the open web for the whole world. This, of course, was the birth of ds106, the digital storytelling community, and I want to tell you about a few pieces of that experiment that were game-changers for me.  First, we decided that every student at UMW participating in ds106 had to get their own domain and Web hosting for the class. We knew they were going to be publishing their work on the Web, but UMW Blogs wasn't enough. They had to fully own their own space. In fact, owning that space, building out their digital identity, and understanding the ensuing narrative would become a crucial, critical piece of the ds106 experience. This notion is one of the ideas at the heart of ds106 and DoOO.  The other thing we did in ds106 was massive syndication. Every participant, whether at UMW or elsewhere, has their individual blog syndicated into the main ds106 site where posts can be filtered and viewed by specific categories and tags. We had been experimenting with syndication for quite some time in UMW Blogs, but never on this scale, and we'd never brought together a community quite like this before. Posts from my students were interwoven with Jim's students and with those of our open participants all over the world.  That commitment to massive syndication and massive openness became a core value of ds106. And the dynamic of having open participants in the mix with our UMW students changed the nature of how we and our students thought about teaching and learning.  My colleagues in the ds106 community from other institutions often helped my students or gave them feedback before I did. In future iterations of ds106, we've had our students collaborate with open participants on large projects, like producing a radio show as well as participating together in synchronous hangouts.  UMW students in ds106 come away with an understanding that there is absolutely nothing standardized about their experience. (They're also usually really exhausted by the end of the course and probably hate us just a little.)  Right off the bat in ds106 we knew we wanted to turn the idea of media assignments on its head. Jim, in teaching the course face-to-face, had ten to twelve specific assignments that he would have the students work through, grouping them around particular media genres or storytelling approaches.  We decided early on that we wanted to blow that model up. And in the vein of massive openness, we built an assignment bank that allowed anyone to submit an assignment idea. They provide a name, a description, an example, and a difficulty rating (one to five stars). We publish it on our assignments site.  When we teach ds106, on a weekly basis we tell people how many stars of work they need to complete. Our students get to choose which assignments to do to meet that goal. When they finish an assignment, they publish it on their own site, and, through the magic of massive syndication, we pull it onto the individual assignment page so future visitors can see how others went about completing the assignment. As of today, we have almost 1000 assignments in the assignment bank and 11 thousand submissions.  I mention ds106 here because it was such an important stop on the road to Domain of One's Own. It validated for us that students were capable of working on the open Web, building and managing their own spaces. And it confirmed for us that we needed to make Domain of One's Own happen on a larger scale.  In fall 2012, we began to pilot DoOO and in fall 2013 the project was fully funded. Today, any UMW student can get a domain name (for the duration of her time at UMW) and open source Web hosting alongside it. Faculty and staff also have access to the project.  I'd like to suggest four goals that are embedded in DoOO.     1. Provide students with the tools and technologies to build out a digital space of their own   2. Help students appreciate how digital identity is formed   3. Provide students with curricular opportunities to use the Web in meaningful ways   4. Push students to understand how the technologies that underpin the Web work, and how that impacts their lives  You'll notice that only one of these goals speaks to teaching and curriculum directly. I sometimes get pushback when I talk about these other three. What does digital identity have to do with college? Why do our students need to muck around in the code? Why can't they use commercially provided tools like WordPress.com or Wix? Don't they already have a space of their own on Facebook? Twitter? Tumblr? Why do they need this one?  I, frankly, find these questions quite perplexing. It seems to me that the Web is the single most powerful media environment to ever exist in our history. I've lived through the last twenty years, and I can't even wrap my head around the changes it has enacted on me personally, much less us culturally. For most of this time, in higher education, we have sat back on our heels, locked in our boxed courses, convincing ourselves that the Web has nothing really to do with us.  It has everything to do with us.  Here's a thought exercise I sometimes give my students. How many times a day do you use Google to search for something? Do you even think about it? I know I don't. I once lost my glasses and tried to Google them. I'm serious.  So you google something, and you get a page of results. How often do you stop to think about what those results mean? Where they came from? What you're seeing and what's being hidden from you? Who decides this? We all know there's an algorithm behind search. Was it written on stone tablets and handed down from on high?  Here's another thought exercise. I have a Facebook account. If I go to Facebook's profile editor it asks me to answer lots of questions. Where do I live? Where do I work? What are my skills? What's my favorite quote? What are my political or religious views? Why does Facebook want to know these things about me? Does it want to be my friend? Does it actually care?  Google and Facebook are cornerstones of the Web. They give us information and they take information from us. They use that information; they control it. They decide what we see, when we see it. Facebook has run experiments to try and change how we feel. Google can from one day to the next drastically alter what the entire world sees when it searches for a presidential candidate, a drug, a breaking news item.  Students drift on the Web from site to site, search engine, to social network. They pull open their phones, they snap a picture, they believe it will disappear in a few seconds. They don't understand how any of it is built, who controls it, who codes it, who changes that code and why.  We can give them opportunities through projects like Domain of One's Own to begin to think critically about what they're doing online. Not through either the fear mongering they've experienced in high school or through Pollyannaish rhetoric about the Web being the ultimate democratizer. But rather by asking them to make things on the Web, to grapple with how those things are managed and controlled, and to consider how what they see on the Web shows up on their screens.  I want to end with a question someone asked me yesterday. Basically, this person wanted to know how to explain or sell DoOO to administrators who are concerned about what happens when it breaks. And my response was, ""You tell them: Good! It broke."" And that's kind of glib. But it's also true.  I can guarantee that if you have a domain of your own stuff will break. It will break in some predictable, easy-to-fix ways and probably in some totally weird, tearing-your-hair out kind of ways. Your students will experience this too. And it will be frustrating and terrible. And it will not be standardized or easily consumed. It will not be easily defined or put in a box. It will be gloriously, awfully messy. And you may have to switch directions or gears, and I hope that when you do you talk to your students about what happened and why it happened  ?  and that you work together to try and figure this out.  And I hope that your students come away from it just a bit more sure of how things are made and how things break and just a bit more curious about how to make things and how to break things.  "Jim Groom,Georgetown Slavery Site,http://bavatuesdays.com/georgetown-slavery-site/,9/3/2016,"One of the things we were given a heads up about recently was the fact that the Georgetown Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation site would be running Georgetown's Domain of One's Own server. Earlier this week they gave us a heads up there may be some interest and, as a result, traffic spikes over the coming days. Tim threw up the W3 Total Cache plugin, and things have held pretty solid thus far (knock on wood). It was wild to see the conversation around this topic emerge in my Twitter stream yesterday, and I was really impressed with Tressie McMillam Cottom's post about why this important move by Georgetown should not be labelled reparations. It was clear this announcement was generating important discussion around questions of history, race, and what it means to make amends as not only an institution, but more generally as a culture.  One of the things I was thinking about when going through the site ? admittedly this is a formalistic observation based on my fascination with what's possible with a domain and web hosting rather than a comment on the question of reparations (although I think Tressie makes the latter point brilliantly) ? was how this announcement was framed as a web-based experience. The main WordPress site, the historical timeline using Timeline.js, the extensive use of video to highlight the conversations had, the Slavery Archive in Omeka, the embedded report, the contact form using Google forms, etc. The whole environment provides a powerful example of what you can create using a bunch of open source and/or free tools through a domain and web hosting account to architect a robust media environment around a topic. Fact is, domains and web hosting are still quite important to build a web of knowledge and understanding how to create a compelling argument using various media including a domain and a few select publishing tools is not dead yet.  "Kate Bowles,"For now, our own",http://musicfordeckchairs.com/blog/2016/09/06/for-now-our-own/,9/6/2016,"> In open online spaces, opening doors is not enough.  Maha Bali, ïReproducing marginality,' September 2016  > We so easily forget our bodies.  Mary Freer, ïThis body goes to work,' August 2016  Over the last week I've been skirting a significant conversation begun by Maha Bali (""I don't own my domain, I rent it"") and continued by Audrey Watters (""A domain of ones own in a post-ownership society""). Never far away is Andrew Rikard's Edsurge post ""Do I own my domain if you grade it?""  The question for me is how the idea of ""own"" works as a metaphor. It's complicated enough as it is: my own, to own, owned, owned. We own our mistakes, we own our work, we own our politics, and none of this is quite like the way we own our homes ? which for most of our working lives means some version of renting, in a funhouse world in which access to credit, like debt itself, has become an asset.  Conceptually, home ownership makes an ironic pass at all this, promising dominion over property that is actually quite a temporary thing in geohistorical time. Home ownership offers a misleading sense of permanence in relation to our provisional space in the world. A home that's owned is always haunted by both its past and future. Far from sheltering us against the churn of things, it's a daily reminder that we're not here for long.  And inside our own homes where we might think of ourselves as free to do as we please, we remain legal subjects, subordinated to the local laws or ways of being to which our citizenship is bent. We house our human bodies, our social selves, our presentability. Our houses face the street; and behind the scenes, who knows what.  As legal subjects, we have modest rights to allow our homes to fall into disrepair, although these are limited by heritage considerations, public health and safety and so on. Zoning laws fence us in. Meanwhile there are all the social obligations of habitation to keep up: from the pragmatics of rent, rates, taxes, body corporate fees and utilities, to the labour of being a considerate neighbour, maintaining a yard, planting a tree that will outlive you. All this takes some skill, some literacy. No one really remembers how we learned to pay bills, or manage our garbage, but we do.  The implication that ownership of things is the beginning of practice of civic participation is something we both assume and overlook when we use ownership as a tech metaphor, without thinking ahead to use. It's as if the ownership of a domain becomes an end in itself. Domain names are fetishised, like novelty license plates. They're collectable and tradable, despite having no inherent functionality except to indicate an empty lot where something might be built, or a lot where something has been abandoned, that might be recaptured at a price for a new project. But achieving naming rights in the use of a domain doesn't come with the skills you need to know what to do next, how to build what people will find if they search at those coordinates.  This is where I've come to in the conversation about whether personal domain ownership is a useful or socially equitable project for higher education. Maha's post set off a deep and thoughtful exchange among some of higher education's most experienced and engaged champions of student and personal blogging. Really, go read through those comments, they're a model for the conversations we should have when we think about bringing tech innovation as a requirement into the lives of others.  As companion pieces, I read Maha's further post on how things get paid for in Egypt; Audrey' post on the impact of student debt on credit score; and two articles by Tressie McMillan Cottom, on the $20 principle and on preferential student recruitment as reparations for slavery (spoiler: it's not reparations.) Then I fell into this exchange on Twitter about the critical importance of making small barriers to educational participation visible, kicked off by Robin deRosa reminding her students to bring a credit card and working laptop to class.  To lower these barriers while keeping them visible, which is very much Robin's project, we have to get much better at noticing them. We need to be scrupulous in attending to the assumptions that lie behind our metaphors, our proposals, our sense of being agents for change largely on the side of the good. We are teaching people with different life experience than our own?different educational capital, cultural capital, actual capital. I teach students for whom a missed shift at work may mean a lost job in a sinkhole local economy; a required online textbook with a digital key may prevent joining the class at all; a credit card may already be maxed or cut up; a laptop may be both so cheap and so broken that it's hard to see through the cracked screen. All of these are actual barriers to participation that actual students have discussed with me in the last four weeks.  And it's easy to say that we have policies or options for students who can't do what we expect, and measures to show that they are in a tiny minority; but in reality we rarely check what disadvantage and/or risk comes with our Plan B. We don't think nearly enough about students for whom the language of digital making is unfamiliar, or the demands of content generation are disempowering and demoralising. We don't adequately accommodate the students who have poor internet access, exhausted data plans, or have to do everything through a second hand phone.  So when we say that it's a good thing for students to own their domain, we need to ask what we mean by owning, and what we think home might be as a metaphor?especially given that the metaphor for our times is not home ownership, or even post-ownership; it's homelessness.  It's the global political scale of this homelessness, the mobility of whole populations for whom the modern projects of both nation and property have entirely fallen apart, that presses an anxiety of ownership on the rest of us. Having a home is more than a matter of shelter, it's the presentation of a certain kind of survivorship, assessed in cultural competence, the assertion of literacy, the visible privilege of know-how. And like home ownership, domain ownership is the practice of insiders, survivors, using the skills and languages that flex their cultural power by asking to be taken entirely for granted, not just in terms of what appears on the screen but increasingly in terms of the coding that lies beneath it.  This weekend I walked past a house that I like. It's in a gentrifying Sydney neighbourhood, defying the trend. It's been taken over by an unpruned wisteria draped over its rotting balcony; curtains are never pulled back from its verandah doors. Who knows what's inside? Who lets their property, in Sydney of all places, fall into this unproductive, vegetative state? But now there's a notice stapled to the fence. Development is planned. The house will be demolished and replaced. There will be a plunge pool. This abandoned property will retake its place in the proper, and properly owned will become an asset to the whole neighbourhood in house price uplift.  Ownership can never be less of a public spectacle than this. It's whole point is to be knowable by others, to turn exclusivity of access and control towards a model of social order and a vision of security that will miraculously extend to all, including those who are most obviously excluded. Owning and gentrifying are inseparable economic forces. So when we talk about securing a domain of one's own, we're also talking about this privatising vision of the proper ? and we're at risk of missing the fragile, important lesson that just as with homes, the security of ownership is always measured against the temporality of the bodies walking past.  Note: This blog is parked with Reclaim Hosting, for whom my admiration is unreserved. None of the questions I'm asking here are a criticism of their model.  ### Share this:     Share       Click to Press This!

"Jim Groom,The Overselling of Open,http://bavatuesdays.com/the-overselling-of-open/,9/14/2016,"I gave two presentations yesterday, one to a faculty cohort at Coventry University about Domain of One's Own, I also presented a session titled ""The Overselling of Open"" as part of the Open Education Tuesdays series through the UNLR. The series started back in May, and has been organized and hosted by Fabio Nascimbeni ? a fellow Italian ??  The event kicked off with a talk by Andreia Inamorato from the Instituto de Prospectiva TecnolÑgica discussed the topic of ""Open Education cases that can change your teaching and learning"" (archived presentation here). it was followed up in June with a talk by Daniel Villar from Coventry University's Disruptive Media Lab who talked about """"OER, MOOCs and beyond: the history of Open Education"" (slides). And next month, October 11th to be exact, Martin Weller will be talking about the 100 best films of the 21st century, don't miss it. There was also a suggestion towards the end of the session that this conversation would continue beyond, and there may soon be another date added with the great Catherine Cronin, so stay tuned.  They couldn't find anyone decent (or European) for September, so they reached out to me, and they got what they deserved! I approached this talk with a certain amount of fear and trembling because I'm quite ambivalent about the open movement more generally these days. What seemed like a movement defined by an anarchic spirit of revolution from 2004-2011 (at least for me ? this was a fairly personal narrative) morphed into a fairly tame, almost conservative approach to education: massive lectures and free textbooks. I'm oversimplifying here of course, but at the same time the mad scramble around corporate sponsored MOOCs for elite universities from 2012 until just about now, coupled with the re-branding of OER, at least in the U.S., as predominantly a cost-saving measure left me fairly depressed. This was not all of ed-tech, for sure, but it certainly has demanded much of the time, energy, and resources of the field for years now. And I must admit I remain somewhat bitter about the funneling of massive resources almost exclusively into these two approaches ? though I'm sure that has been part a significant part of their own struggle.  Anyway, this talk was my feeble attempt to start to come to terms with that ? kind of like presentation as personal therapy. In preparing the talk, if you can call it that, I kept returning to two people: Martin Weller and Audrey Watters. Specifically Weller's The Battle for Open and just about everything Audrey has done since 2011, but probably most powerfully for me (although it's hard to choose) was her 2013 keynote ""The Education Apocalypse"" wherein she frames the Silicon Valley narrative that is driving the defunding and dismantling of higher ed. That talk was like a diamond through my forehead explaining what's really happening in ed-tech.  At the same time, I think the idea undergirding Weller's book that while Open has won, the hard part of actually shaping what it looks like is the reality we are currently working within. The point reverberated deeply with me this time around, and I think Weller's assessment of the situation in his book defines my confusion and frustration far more cogently than I ever could. At least in part, the reason I fell relatively quiet during the larger conversations around MOOCs and OERs has been my concerns with the obsession with scale and money (often framed as savings). So re-reading The Battle for Open was a good reminder that in the wake of the hype there is a lot of important work to be done. I haven't entirely been sitting on my hands given the work with ds106 and then Domain of One's Own, which gave way to Reclaim Hosting ? all of which reinforce the idea that small is beautiful ? and the best way at building an open web that matters is helping as many people as possible start small and reclaim a piece of the web. I don't think this is the one true way, but it's what I know and what I have done ? my ideas in many ways are the product of this blog.  And while this is anything but a summary of my discussion, which was even more free-ranging and incoherent, Mike Caulfield's recent post ""Putting Student- Produced OER at the Heart of the Institution"" (born from a rich Twitter discussion) helped me articulate another concern I have with framing OER as an institutional concern. Caulfield notes that many of the projects he has been working on over the years have been ghost-towned, and one way to avoid this that the OER content folks have been successful is making the broader institutional, and even federal charge for managing and producing these resource that would give the open pedagogy folks far greater resources in time. In fact, institutional funding and support become the key to the life of these web-based resources:  > But institutions, they are what make these things last. And my sense is that the recurring cycle of CELT and TLT center layoffs is all you need to look at to see how much of what we do is built on sand. It scares the heck out of me. It really does.  For me its that first sentence ""but institutions, they are what make these things last"" that I deeply question. One of the things I discussed in this regard during this talk was the amazing panel at OER16 where some impressive folks (Lorna Campbell, Viv Rolfe, David Kernohan, Simon Thompson, and Pat Lockley) from all over the UK talked about how so many of the openly produced OERs that were publicly funded were no longer available. And these are resources supported by public institutions, and eventually that money ran dry. I think this should be a huge cautionary tale for OER as an ongoing institutional resource.  But wait, there is more. The second part of this quote by Caulfield wherein he talks about the cuts of ed-tech groups like his former group at Keene State University (and recent cuts at Plymouth State as well) suggest that if anything the institutions have become less and less of a solution to our educational problems. And an example I kept harping on yesterday was the unprecedented faculty lockout at Long Island University, Brooklyn. I mean this highlights for me the larger context in which these conversations are happening, and the austerity we have lived through since 2008 (or since 1980 if you are counting all of it) in higher ed has put institutions of higher ed in direct conflict with those who work there. And I believe the cost-cutting promises of ed-tech more generally in the form of open courses or open resources has further fueled the politics of defunding higher-ed. This was no where apparent to me during my time in Virginia when it was apparent politicians were only interested in OERs because they could immediately point to saving people money, while at the same time stagnating, or even cutting, funds to institutions and salaries.  This look at salaries over two decades for public 2 and 4 year institutions in the US is alarming  The idea of funding stuff like textbooks or technologies rather than people may have short-term benefits for saving students money that we can see as a short-term win within the world we live, but the idea that may lead to larger long-term victories (which I read as a recognition and funding of people and pedagogies) is dubitable at best. But when you look at the state of labor and salaries in U.S. higher ed (not to mention the attack on tenure in Wisconsin) I tend to doubt that institutions, given the funding bind they find themselves in, will be the safeguards of these resources.  All of which reminds me of who, when all was said and done, saved more than a decade of web history in the form of Geocities from deletion at the hands of Yahoo! in 2010? Was it other corporations? Higher ed? The government? Nope, it was dozens of rogue archivists, technologists, artists, and librarians from around the world that cared, and for me that is a reminder that we can't leave something as important as teaching and learning on the web to institutions ? no less the archiving and preservation of those resources. That has to be managed by faculty and students themselves as part of a broader sense of awareness of owning and managing their digital education.  But I protest too much, I know. This is kind of what I wanted to talk about yesterday, but I'm not sure I covered it all, but I can promise it is no more coherent than this. The recording is not up yet, but when it becomes available I'll be sure to link it here. But this post is also my attempt to stop moping about some of this and frame the open I want to see more clearly. Complaining is the easy part, working towards something else is the hard part.      Though the fact was probably not a noticeable loss in the broader scheme given the regular, unforgiving, and often fun critique from folks in ed-tech like Audrey, Mike Caulfield, David Kernohan, and Alan Levine to name a few.  Image credits:     Alan Levine's image of Audrey Watters is awesome.    Found image of Martin Weller on Steve Wheeler's blog, who attributes Martin.  "Jim Groom,Opening Pandora's Box at Coventry,http://bavatuesdays.com/opening-pandoras-box-at-coventry/,9/14/2016,"Yesterday I spoke with a faculty cohort at Coventry University about creating their own portfolios. This group was part of the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice in Higher Education (or PgCert) course led by Martin Jenkins. PgCert provides professional development for faculty and staff, and this cohort will be building out a portfolio as part of the process. This is exciting because it builds on what Chris Long calls ""online scholarly presence,"" which provided a great frame for my discussion. Not sure it was recorded, but I've included the slides below that link to the various resources I discussed during the short presentation if you're interested.  This was also exciting because it's the precursor to a longer trip I'll be taking to Coventry next week to talk to a number of staff, faculty, and students about opening up the Pandora's Box that is Domain of One's Own on their campus. I'm not saying they're going to be running the very first Domains project in the UK at Coventry University through the Disruptive Media Learning Labƒ.at least I'm not saying that just yet ?? Who knows, there may even be a 90s computer lab/living room in our future!

Jonathan Shaw (@timemotion) September 21, 2016  I guess if the big boss is making it public, it's safe to say that Reclaim Hosting has been helping Coventry University get up and running with a pilot of Domain of One's Own (DoOO). As I alluded to in a previous post, hosting Coventry Domains on Digital Ocean has enabled us to comply with Europe's data privacy requirements while offering a fast, seamless experience. In fact, given the miserable day we had with our Reliable Site datacenter in New Jersey, having Coventry Domains hosted in Digital Ocean's London data center has been a total godsend. There will be more of that to come soon.  This is pretty exciting for both Coventry and Reclaim because this is officially the first school in the UK (Virginia Woolf would be proud!) that is exploring Domains on a broader, institutional scale. One of the things that has had me blown away over the last two days of workshops (I've done 6 already and there will be 9 all told) is the turn out. I've helped a number of schools get up and running with a pilot, but I have to say that Coventry's roll-out is not feeling very pilot-y. I've met with more than 50 faculty and staff the last two days, and there are 30+ more scheduled for tomorrow! Crazy, and a number of faculty have modules (the strange term the English use for courses) with as many as 80-120 students they want to get up and running with digital portfolios, project sites, blogs, etc. I have been extremely impressed by the enthusiasm of faculty and staff ? that have been waiting for this. And as I already joked on Twitter, they may very well need a bigger boat.  > Really impressed with turn-out and interest in Coventry's Domain of One's Own initiative. I think they're gonna need a bigger boat ??  >  >  ?  Jim Groom (@jimgroom) September 21, 2016  The lion's share of the credit for making all of this happen goes to Daniel Villar-Onrubia, who has spearheaded and led the initiative quite adeptly. Daniel works at Coventry's Disruptive Media Learning Lab (which is sponsoring this pilot), and he has tirelessly seen this project to fruition over the last five months ? which justifies major kudos. Institutional due diligence and attention to process in Britain can invoke scenes from Dickens' Bleak House at times ?? I was particularly touched when Daniel introduced me as a Visiting Fellow at the Disruptive Media Learning Lab ? it felt like old times. I've been holed up in my Italian mountain fortress for the last several months, so working intensely with Daniel to get Domains out in front of the university community for the last two days has been equal parts exhilarating and exhausting. We make a good team, and it reminded me a bit of all those beginnings of the semester at UMW we spent getting folks fired up about publishing on the web ? that never gets old for me.  I have more to blog about regarding my time at Coventry, catching up with the great Helen Keegan and the Game Changers (great band name, right?), talking living rooms and buses, etc. But Daniel has me on a tight and early schedule ? he is a bit of a task master ? so I need to have my tea and biscuits before hitting the kip. Cheerio!  "Jesse Stommel,"A Brief History of Domain of One's Own, Part 1",http://umwdtlt.com/a-brief-history-of-domain-of-ones-own-part-1/,9/21/2016,"# A Brief History of Domain of One's Own, Part 1  September 21, 2016  |In Domain of One's Own, Open Education  |By Jesse Stommel and Jess Reingold  Domain of One's Own (DoOO) is not just a platform. It's a philosophy. A history, then, can not just account for the development of the technologies but must also account for the thinking that brought the project to life.  Our goal with this series of posts is to offer a version of that history. Our approach isn't about establishing a chronology; rather, we want to explore the origins and genealogy of the project, to capture its spirit, and to look toward its future. Because DoOO focuses so intimately on identity and what it means to be fully human on the web, we are starting this series with our stories  ?  how we came to know Domain of One's Own, how it has shaped us, and how we will help shape it.  ## What is DoOO?  Domain of One's Own is a project that gives all University of Mary Washington students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to get a domain name with hosted web space. The domain and web space are free for the time they're at the University. The project has a rich origin. Since 2004 every member in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies has had a domain name and Web hosting. That was also when DTLT, began experimenting with open source platforms, which made the Web more accessible. One of the founders of DoOO, Martha Burtis, explains how open sources tools ""made it possible to build learning environments that empowered students, and not necessarily to the detriment of the course."" In 2007, DTLT began to wonder, ""what if every faculty member and student had their own domain name and their own space on the Web?""  Eventually, the ""what if's,"" became ""needs."" Members of the UMW Community needed ""a space online that they not only control and own but they understand how it works."" Thus, Domain of One's Own was born. Through the hard work of Martha Burtis, Jim Groom, and Tim Owens, along with the rest of DTLT, Domain of One's Own piloted in 2012 with a small cohort of faculty and students. Part of the success of that first year was the faculty development initiative sponsored by DTLT and Mary Kayler in UMW's Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation. Almost immediately, the project garnered national and international attention. Starting in 2013, domains became available for any member of the UMW community, including staff, faculty, and students. There are currently over 2000 active UMW Domains.  Domain of One's Own is in part a response and an antidote to the emerging discussion around ePortfolios, while also resisting traditional educational platforms that look nothing like the rest of the Web. According to Audrey Watters, the project helps faculty, staff, and students at UMW ""have more control over their scholarship, data, and digital identity.""  ## Discovering Domain of One's Own  I (Jess) first encountered Domain of One's Own on August 29th, 2012. Over the summer of 2012, I took a web authoring and design class at George Mason University. GMU provided us a tilde space where we could host our hand-coded websites using our newfound HTML and CSS skills. Upon returning to UMW, I looked to see if UMW had tilde spaces for students, because I wanted to continue to practice. After much googling, I found a blog post that Jim Groom had written the day before called Documenting Domain of One's Own. I didn't know him, I didn't know about UMW's Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT), I just knew I wanted web space, preferably free. After reading the post, which explained more about the pilot, I boldly commented, ""Hi, I'm a student here at UMW and this sounds like a great idea! Can students sign up for it now? If not, because it's still a work in progress, how can I access my webspace via Secure File Transfer application? I was doing so at GMU over the summer and I was hoping I could here too, just to start working a site that I'd use primarily to showcase my future history research projects."" With the encouragement of my professor, Susan Fernsebner, I created a website for the final presentation in my History Seminar. From there, I continued to redesign the sites I built by hand until I was introduced to WordPress by a (former) DTLT member, Ryan Brazell.  I worked with course blogs and WordPress throughout the rest of my time as an undergraduate at UMW. In 2014, my relationship with Domain of One's Own changed significantly. While taking Jeff McClurken's Adventures in Digital History course, I got to spend time in DTLT learning how to make child themes in WordPress. When DTLT moved to the Hurley Convergence Center, I applied to be a tutor at the Digital Knowledge Center (DKC), a peer tutoring center where students get help with digital projects. The possibility of working with digital tools and platforms interested me, and so I also added a Digital Studies minor just before my senior year. I went from dabbling with my domain to thinking critically about how Domain of One's Own could help me build and shape my digital identity. This is when I realized how a project like DoOO could help students and faculty rethink how the web works and what we can do there.  In my role as a tutor at the DKC, I was supervised and mentored by Martha Burtis. I learned a lot and got experience with a bunch of digital tools. I learned what the backend of Domain of One's Own looks like and how to fix common problems on the system. For me it was all very exciting  ?  to see under the hood of a large scale project like DoOO. I was also able to witness DTLT at work, consulting with faculty just on the other side of the glass from where I was working in the DKC. They were empowering faculty and I was empowering students. However, I knew my time with the DKC and interacting with DTLT was going end. That thing called graduation happened, and I threw my resume out to a bunch of jobs that had digital components, but none were as interesting as the work I had done at UMW. DTLT announced an Entry-Level position, and it felt like the job had been created just for me. I applied, interviewed, and got the job. Now with my new colleagues, I support WordPress and Domain of One's Own, and present to classes about digital identity. I'm looking forward to the future of Domain of One's and what my second year in DTLT has in store!  ## Inhabiting the Course, Inhabiting the Web  I (Jesse) knew I wanted to be a teacher when I was a 9-year-old kid. My mom was in graduate school, and I'd stay up with her late into the night while she studied. Sometimes, I'd do her Anatomy Coloring Book homework for her, but I'd also spend hours piling up her textbooks to design syllabi. (I didn't actually know the word ""syllabi"" at the time.) In 1999, I helped design my first official syllabus as a teaching assistant. In 2001, shortly after I started teaching courses of my own, I decided to eliminate paper syllabi. Taking my classes paperless was as much environmentally motivated as it was driven by a gut instinct that the syllabus for a course shouldn't be static  ?  that the syllabus should be dynamic and that students should have a hand in creating the framework for a course. If my 9-year-old self could design syllabi, why do teachers patronize to adult students by dictating to them the shape of their learning? Not all teacher-created syllabi are bad, and I believe the teacher has an important role in helping to shape the learning that happens in a class. But syllabi, as long as I've known them, are too often defensive documents aimed at controlling students through absurd levels of bureaucracy.  So, in 2002, I started hosting my own syllabi on the web, but they were more than just syllabi. Over the years, they morphed increasingly into course sites authored as much by students as by me. I would open the space, but I was only one of many that would inhabit it. And I'd often use the course site from one semester as a starting point for the next, so students would also build upon each other's thinking from semester to semester across years. As much as possible, I tried to de-emphasize the administrivia of a conventional syllabus (the bits required by institutions) so that the subjects of the course and student work would be foregrounded. I also made my course sites conversation spaces, starting with e-mail lists, evolving through Google groups, blog comments, and Twitter feeds. My goal was always to destabilize the ""front of the class""  ?  to show up as a teacher myself but to create ample opportunities for students also to show up as teachers.  The Domain of One's Own project at University of Mary Washington caught my attention very early on, as it germinated, well before it was fully rolled out on campus. At the schools where I'd taught, my work had always been done against the flow of the institution. But UMW was supporting the work at an institutional level and making the work explicitly about student agency. When I talked to Jeff McClurken about my current position as Executive Director of DTLT, he had me at hello. And this is why: In a recent conversation about DoOO, Jeff remarked, ""It is sadly unusual to tell students the work they do in their classes is theirs. That it matters. That they should share it. That they own it. That their digital identity can be developed by them, not by their teachers, the institution, and not, Dear God, by the LMS."" Learning is not static. Students are not receptacles. Technology should not be about surveillance. The web is a place we can inhabit. These things are at the heart of Domain of One's Own, which as of 2016 has been enshrined in UMW's Strategic Plan.  ## Looking Forward  We (Jess and Jesse) now work together (with the rest of DTLT) to help shepherd Domain of One's Own. But we recognize that the work is the result of so many that came before us. There was an idea, and that idea had parents, but so much of the work of DoOO has been done in the classroom by faculty at UMW and the thousands of students they've collaborated with. So much labor, and so much heart, have gone into this project. Jess's experience has been vital to DTLT, because she's worked on all sides of the platform. And we've also learned immensely from the expanding community of institutions around the world starting their own DoOO-inspired initiatives. The project continues to grow and change. As Martha Burtis writes, ""By letting this project emerge in an organic way, we can let it become what it needs to become.""  Over the next few years, what we'd like to see, is for the DoOO community to increasingly become a student community  ?  not just technologists talking to each other from one institution to another. How can we open our pedagogies so that students at schools around the world are inhabiting the space of the web together  ?  so that our classes are made permeable and allow students to engage on the public web across cultural and geographic boundaries?  And how do we make sure that these spaces are not obligatory  ?  that they are spaces students choose to make, choose to inhabit, choose to learn within, and perhaps choose to continue learning within once they graduate? As UMW faculty member Debra Schleef writes, it should be ""a choice to keep one's domain, to change it significantly, or not to use it at all."" How do we assure that DoOO doesn't become another space, like the LMS, designed to track, monitor, regulate, and control students?  To answer these questions, we find ourselves looking back even as we look forward, and so our hope with this series of posts is to investigate the history (anecdotal and otherwise) of DoOO, even as we continue to imagine its future.

But the project did not begin there. As Martha Burtis relayed in her keynote at Digital Pedagogy Lab this summer, a long process of brainstorming, tinkering, and pilot projects preceded the whole-campus launch of Domain of One's Own. Yesterday, Jess Reingold and Jesse Stommel posted the first in a series of accounts of the history of Domain of One's Own. Today, we offer an infographic outlining key moments in the project's history, as well as acknowledging the many institutions now conducting similar initiatives. (If your institution is missing, please let us know!)  Domain of One's Own is a project that is deep, broad, and growing. As Jess and Jesse wrote, ""we find ourselves looking back even as we look forward."" As we at DTLT collaborate with our faculty and students to keep imagining the future of Domain of One's Own at Mary Washington, we are both humbled and exhilarated by the efforts that so many have ? and continue to ? put into this initiative, here and elsewhere. We hope this infographic becomes obsolete quickly, as new names and new projects emerge.

"Tom Vander Ark,"Encourage Writing with a Domain, Blog & Portfolio",http://gettingsmart.com/2014/12/encourage-writing-domain-blog-portfolio/,12/29/2014,"Every learner (i.e., everyone) should have a domain?a place to share what they are learning and a collection of personal bests. Why? There are probably a dozen reasons. More writing for one ? and writing for public audiences which promotes authenticity, clarity, and humility. A domain can build æagency and encourage learning and reflection beyond the formal curriculum. It can boost motivation, expression, and creativity. Students could pick up a few coding skills. An intentionally curated portfolio could boost employability. With cheaper web hosting and great?often free?tools, a growing number of schools and universities are encouraging learners to create a domain and a digital portfolio. The University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia provides its faculty and 5,000 students with a domain to, ""Explore the creation and development of their digital identities."" The Domain of One's Ownæinitiative facilitates WordPress installation, provides technical support, and hosts the site until graduation?and then the domain and content remains the student's. Students write about anthropology, the Internet, 3d printing and GIS mapping. In her exhaustive and otherwise dark review of 2014, Audrey Watters called Domain of One's Own one of the most important initiatives in EdTech and notes that it has spread to multiple campuses this year ? Davidson College, Emory University, the University of Oklahoma, and CSU Channel Islands are all now piloting ""Domain""-like initiatives. We'd love to see secondary schools join the wave and, in addition to a take-home device, provide a portable domain for every student.

One of them, Gardner Campbell, invited me to speak at the University of Mary Washington's Faculty Academy on Instructional Technologies. There I met an inspired team of thinkers and doers who were pioneering the academic use of what we now call cloud technology.  UMW isn't a wealthy school; there wasn't a big budget for IT; that was a constraint well embraced. Gardner's dream team found their way to BlueHost where, for $8/month, they could spin up web servers, wikis, and most importantly the blogs that have become central to the intellectual life of the school. Here's Jim Groom, aka Mr. Edupunk, reflecting on what UMW Blogs has become.  > Me and UMW Blogs are going on 5 years this Summer, she's is the baddest of the bad and meanest and leanest of the mean and lean. She's a veritable titan of her kind, she's an educational publishing platform of the very best kind, and she's turning five. Five years ago from roughly May through August we brought together the early MistyLook themed WPMu and MediaWiki hybrid out into this wasteland of bad BlackBoard installs, and we shone a light.  >  > A light of good publishing practices, a site for everyone regardless of his or her class status, and course spaces that actually looked good. We were already dreaming of fancy syndication, course aggregation, and a space attractive and user friendly enough that you would actually want to have a stake in it. It worked, five years later we have more than 6500 sites and 8500 users, and that number has steadily increased over these past five years. We run heavy traffic sites like UMW Bullet and EagleEye, or blogs for alumni 3 and 4 years out. We have aggregated blog posts from more than 40 UMW students who have written about their travels around the world, and some class sites that imagine a whole new use for online space discussion, tags and the community in the virtual. There are student created research sites I'd put up against any university's publicly open and shared work. Not to mention more than 35 original literary journals created by UMW students.  For UMW, the openness of BlueHost's proto-cloud was a liberating alternative to the closed learning management systems that all my ed-tech pals rail against. And it raised important questions about habits that had developed over the years. Why, for example, should a university provide its students with temporary cyberinfrastructure  ?  email accounts, web hosting  ?  that was increasingly redundant for many, and would in any case be supplanted after graduation?  In a 2007 talk at EDUCAUSE, I made the case that the infrastructure was moving to the cloud where students could, and would, take care of their own services, relying on standards to interoperate with the institutions they'd serially associate with during their careers and lives.  Writing for EDUCAUSE Review in 2009, Gardner Campbell took the argument a step further. In A Personal Cyberinfrastructure he argued that learning to build and operate a personal cloud was a life skill students would need and should be taught.  > As part of the first-year orientation, each student would pick a domain name. Over the course of the first year, in a set of lab seminars facilitated by instructional technologists, librarians, and faculty advisors from across the curriculum, students would build out their digital presences in an environment made of the medium of the web itself.  >  > They would play with wikis and blogs; they would tinker and begin to assemble a platform to support their publishing, their archiving, their importing and exporting, their internal and external information connections. They would become, in myriad small but important ways, system administrators for their own digital lives. In short, students would build a personal cyberinfrastructure, one they would continue to modify and extend throughout their college career  ?  and beyond.  >  > In building that personal cyberinfrastructure, students not only would acquire crucial technical skills for their digital lives but also would engage in work that provides richly teachable moments ranging from multimodal writing to information science, knowledge management, bibliographic instruction, and social networking.  Note step one of the plan: ""Pick a domain name."" That's the root of every personal cloud. Teaching students to stake out their own cloud namespaces, to which they'll attach a variety of services, is an excellent lesson. That's why I was delighted to hear recently from Jim Groom about an effort called A Domain of One's Own. (The name is, of course, a hat tip to Virginia Woolf.) There are now hundreds of UMW students, Jim tells me, who have established their own domain names and bound their blogs to them. While they remain students those blogs federate with other UMW blogs  ?  and with blogs elsewhere, because teaching and learning don't end at the university's border. But when these students graduate their blogs do not evaporate like discarded blue books. They live on as part of the students' own personal clouds. Nice!  Go Back to Top.

"Chad Jardine,"Giving Power Back to the People . . . Well, the Students",https://blog.goreact.com/giving-power-back-to-the-people-well-the-students/,none,"## The Internet is empowering in many ways. Consumers have more power. Individuals and movements have more power. One thing we don't have is more privacy. Every time we turn around someone is asking for our data. Where that data goes next is anyone's guess.  Online identities are so prolific that they can even be stolen. Much more common than identity theft is data mining as our information gets sifted through and all kinds of decisions made about and because of it.  In fact, it's so common to give out info that sharing personal data is a daily fact of life for many college students. They create one identity after another on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and more ? choosing what to share, when to share it, and with whom.  Sharing personal data is a daily fact of life on social media.  In her recent edSurge article, Marguerite McNeal explores the rising idea of adopting a similar user-controlled approach to student data ? imagine a student having the ability to share (or hide) aspects of his academic profile with instructors or counselors, much like he manages his Facebook profile. McNeal explains,  > ""The idea is to give students autonomy in how they develop and manage their digital identities at the university and well into their professional lives.""  And it's more than an esoteric idea. Domain of One's Own is a project hosted by the University of Mary Washington that ""allows UMW students, faculty, and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a space on a UMW-managed Web server."" The project moves a step beyond the privacy control you have on social media, giving students the ability to create and manage their own domain. Brigham Young University's Phil Windley suggests that such an approach will ""help students understand their personal identity."" Windley is working with BYU to run Domain of One's Own at BYU and build personal APIs that would ""[put] students at the center of their learning experience.""  ## And that's what we've always wanted of students, right?

"Michael Feldstein,The EDUCAUSE NGDLE and an API of One's Own,http://mfeldstein.com/the-educause-ngdle-and-an-api-of-ones-own/,6/14/2015,"I have been meaning for some time to get around to blogging about the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative's (ELI's) paper on a Next-Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) and Tony Bates' thoughtful response to it. The core concepts behind the NGDLE are that a next-generation digital learning environment should have the following characteristics: Interoperability and Integration Personalization Analytics, Advising, and Learning Assessment Collaboration Accessibility and Universal Design The paper also suggests that the system should be modular. They draw heavily on an analogy to LEGOs and make a call for more robust standards. In response, Bates raises three concerns: He is suspicious of a potentially heavy and bureaucratic standards-making process that is vulnerable to undue corporate influence. He worries that LEGO is a poor metaphor that suggests an industrialized model. He is concerned that, taken together, the ELI requirements for an NGDLE will push us further in the direction of computer-driven rather than human-driven classes. As it happens, ELI's vision for NGDLE bears a significant resemblance to a vision that some colleagues and I came up with ten years ago when we were trying to help the SUNY system find an LMS that would fit the needs of all 64 campuses,[1] ranging from small, rural community colleges to R1 universities to medical and ophthalmology schools to a school of fashion. We got pretty deep into thinking about the implementation details, so it's been on my mind to write my own personal perspective on the answers to Tony's questions, based in large part on that previous experience. In the meantime, Jim Groom, who has made a transition from working at a university to working full-time at Reclaim Hosting, has written a series of really provocative and, to me, exciting posts on the future of the digital learning environment from his own perspective. Jim shares the starting assumption of the ELI and SUNY that a learning environment should be ""learner-centric,"" but he has a much more fully developed (and more radical) idea of what that really means, based on his previous work with A Domain of One's Own. He also, in contrast to the ELI and SUNY teams, does not start from the assumption that ""next-generation"" means evolving the LMS. Rather, the questions he seems to be asking are ""What is minimum amount of technical infrastructure required to create a rich digital learning environment?"" and ""Of that minimal amount of infrastructure we need, what is the minimal amount that needs to be owned by the institution rather than the learner?"" I see these trains of thought emerging his posts on a university API, a personal API, and a syndication bus. What's exciting to me about these posts is that, even though Jim is starting from a very different set of assumptions, he is also converging on something like the vision we had for SUNY. In this post, I'm going to try to respond to both Tony and Jim. One of the challenges of this sort of conversation is that the relationship between the technical architecture and the possibilities it creates for the learners is complex. It's easy to oversimplify or even conflate the two if we're not very careful. So one of the things that I'm going to try to do here is untangle the technical talk from the functional talk. I'll start with Tony Bates' concerns. The Unbearable Heaviness of Standards This is the most industry-talky part of the post, but it's important for the later stuff. So if talk of Blackboard and Pearson sitting around a technical standards development table turns you off, please bear with me. Bates writes, First, this seems to be much too much of a top-down approach to developing technology-based learning environments for my taste. Standards are all very well, but who will set these standards? Just look at the ways standards are set in technology: international committees taking many years, with often powerful lobby groups and ïrogue' corporations trying to impose new or different standards. Is that what we want in education? Or will EDUCAUSE go it alone, with the rest of the world outside the USA scrambling to keep up, or worse, trying to develop alternative standards or systems? (Just watch the European Commission on this one.) Attempts to standardize learning objects throughæmeta-data have not had much success in education, for many good reasons, but EDUCAUSE is planning something much more ambitious than this. Let me start by acknowledging, as somebody who has been involved in the sausage-making, that the technical standards development process is inherently difficult and fraught and that, because it is designed to produce a compromise that everybody can live with, it rarely produces a specification that anybody is thrilled with. Technical standards-making sucks, and its output often sucks as well. In fact, both process and output generally suck so badly that they collectively beg the question: Why would anyone ever do it? The answer is simple: Standards are usually created when the pain of not having a standard exceeds the pain of creating and living with one. One of the biggest pains driving technical standards-making in educational technology has been the pain of vendor lock-in. Back in the days when Blackboard owned the LMS market and the LMS product category pretty much was the educational technology market, it was hard to get anyone developing digital learning tools or digital content to integrate with any other platform. Because there were no integration standards, anyone who wanted to integrate with both Blackboard and Moodle would have to develop that integration twice. Add in D2L and Sakai„this was pre-Canvas„and you had four times the effort. This is a problem in any field, but it's particularly a problem in education because neither students nor courses are widgets. This means that we need a ton of specialized functionality, down to a very fine level. For example, both art historians and oncologists need image annotation tools to teach their classes digitally, but they use those tools very differently and therefore need different features. Ed tech is full of tiny (but important) niches, which means that there are needs for many tools that will make nobody rich. You're not going to see a startup go to IPO with their wicked good art history image annotation tool. And so, inevitably, the team that develops such a tool will start small and stay small, whether they are building a product for sale, an open source project, or some internal project for a university or for their own classes. Having to develop for multiple platforms is just not feasible for a small team, which means the vast majority of teaching functionality will be available only on the most widely adopted platform. Which, in turn, makes that platform very hard to leave, because you'd also have to give up all those other great niche capabilities developed by third parties. But there was a chicken-and-egg problem. To Tony's point about the standards process being prone to manipulation, Blackboard had nothing to gain and a lot to lose from interoperability standards back when they dominated the market. They had a lot to gain from talking about standards, but nothing to gain (and a lot to lose) by actually implementing good standards. In those days, the kindest interpretation of their behavior in the IMS (which is the main technical standards body for ed tech) is that standards-making was not a priority for them. A more suspicious mind might suspect that there were times when they actively sabotaged those efforts. And they could, because a standard that wasn't implemented by the platform used by 70% of the market was not one that would be adopted by those small tool makers. They would still have to build at least two integrations„one for Blackboard and one for everyone else. Thankfully, two big changes in the market disrupted this dynamic. First, Blackboard lost its dominance, thanks in part to the backlash among customers against just such anti-competitive behavior. It is no coincidence that then-CEO Michael Chasen chose to retain Ray Henderson, who was known for his long-standing commitment to open standards (andƒumƒactually caring about customer needs) right at the point when Blackboard backlash was at its worst and the company faced the probability of a mass exodus as they killed off WebCT. Second, content-centric platforms became increasingly sophisticated with consequent increasingly sophisticated needs for integrating other tools. This was driven by the collapse of the textbook publishers' business model and their need to find some other way to justify their existence, but it was a welcome development for standards both because it brought more players to the table and because the world desperately needed (and still needs) alternative visions to the LMS for a digital learning environment, and the textbook publishers have the muscle to actually implement and drive adoption of their own visions. It doesn't matter so much whether you like those visions or the players who are pushing them (although, honestly, almost anything would be a welcome change from the bento box that was and, to a large degree, still is the traditional LMS experience). What mattered from the standards-making perspective is that there were more players who had something to prove in the market and whose ideas about how niche functionality should integrate with the larger learning experience that their platform affords was not all the same. As a result, we are getting substantially richer and more polished ed tech integration standards more quickly from the IMS than we were getting a decade ago. Unfortunately, the change in the market only helps with one of the hard problems of technical standards-making in ed tech. Another one, which Bates alludes to with his comment about failed efforts to standardize metadata for learning objects, is finding the right level of abstraction. There are a lot of reasons why learning objects have failed to gain the traction that advocates had hoped, but one good one is that there is no such thing as a learning object. At least, not one that we can define generically. What is it that syllabi, quizzes, individual quiz questions, readings, videos, simulations, week-long collections of all these things (or ""modules""), and 15-week collections of these things (or ""courses"") have in common? It is tempting to pretend that all of these things are alike in some fundamental way so that we can easily reuse them and build new things with them. You knowƒlike LEGOs. If they were, then it would make sense to have one metadata standard to describe them all, because it would mean that the main challenge of building a new course out of old pieces would be finding the right pieces, and a metadata standard can help with that. Alas. Folks who are non-technical tend to think of software as a direct implementation of their functional needs, and their understanding of technical standards flows from that view of the world. As a result, it's easy to overgeneralize the lesson of the learning object metadata standards failures. But the history of computing is one of building up successive layers of abstraction. For example, TCP/IP is a low-level technical standard that enables internet servers to connect to and communicate with each other, whether that communication takes the form of sending email, transferring a file, or looking up the address of a web site. Most of us don't know about or care about what sorts of connections TCP/IP allows or doesn't allow. At our level, it is indistinguishable from LEGOs in the sense tha we see these pieces fitting together generically and we don't see a need for them to do anything else. But the programmers who built TCP/IP implemented it on top of the C programming language (which was standard in the informal sense that eventually became a Standard(TM) in the formal sense), which compiled to a number of different machine languages for different computer chips, making those chips more like LEGOs. Then other programmers created HTML and Javascript as a abstraction layers on top of TCP/IP, making web pages like LEGOs in the sense that any web server can serve any standards-conformant web page and any browser can read any such web page. From here, higher layers of abstraction get dicier, which is probably why we don't have many higher-level Standards(TM). Instead, we start getting into things called ""libraries"" and ""frameworks"". These are bits of code that are re-usable by enough developers that they are worth sharing and adopting, but not so much that they are worth going through the pain of formal standards development or become universal through some other means. And then, of course, there is just a vast amount of development on the web that is individual to the project and cannot be standardized, whether formally or informally. If you try to standardize that which is not standard, chances are that your ""standard"" will remain pretty non-standard. So there is a generic danger that if we try to build a standard at the wrong level of abstraction, we will fail. But in education there is also the danger that we will try to build at the wrong level of abstraction and succeed. What I mean by this is we will enshrine a limited or even stunted vision of what kinds of teaching and learning a digital learning environment should support into the fundamental building blocks that we use to create new learning environments and learning experiences. In What Sense Like LEGOs? To wit, Bates writes: A next generation digital learning environment where all the bits fit nicely together seems far too restrictive for the kinds of learning environments we need in the future. What about teaching activities and types of learning that don't fit so nicely? We need actually to move away from the standardization of learning environments. We have inherited a largely industrial and highly standardized system of education from the 19th century designed around bricks and mortar, and just as we are able to start breaking way from rigid standardization EDUCAUSE wants to provide a digital educational environmentæbased on standards. I have much more faith in the ability of learners, and less so but still a faith in teachers and instructors, to be able to combine a wide range of technologies in the ways that they decide makes most sense for teaching and learning than a bunch of computer specialists setting technical standards (even in consultation with educators). Audrey Watters captured the subtlety of this challenge beautifully in her piece on the history of LEGO Mindstorms: In some ways, the educational version of Mindstorms faces a similar problem as it struggles to balance imagination with instructions. As the product have become more popular in schools, Lego Education has added new features that make Mindstorms more amenable to the classroom, easier for teachers to use: portfolios, curriculum, data-logging and troubleshooting features for teachers, and so on. ""Little by little, the subversive features of the computer were eroded away. Instead of cutting across and challenging the very idea of subject boundaries, the computer now defined a new subject; instead of changing the emphasis from impersonal curriculum to excited live exploration by students, the computer was now used to reinforce School's ways. What had started as a subversive instrument of change was neutralized by the system and converted into an instrument of consolidation."" ? Seymour Papert, The Children's Machine That constructionist element is still there, of course ? in Lego the toy and in Lego Mindstorms. Children of all ages continue to build amazing things. Yet as Mindstorms has become a more powerful platform ? in terms of its engineering capabilities and its retail and educational success ? it has paradoxically perhaps also become a less playful one. There is a fundamental tension between making something more easily adoptable for a broad audience and making it challenging in the way that education should be challenging, i.e., that it is generative and encourages creativity (a quality that Amy Collier, Jen Ross, and George Veletsianos have started calling ""not-yetness""). I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, my LEGO kits didn't look like this: If I wanted to build the Millennium Falcon, I would have to figure out how to build it from scratch, which meant I was more likely to decide that it was too hard and that I couldn't do it. But it also meant I was much more likely to build my own idea of a space ship rather than reproducing George Lucas' idea. This is a fundamental and inescapable tension of educational technology (as well as the broad reuse or mass production of curricular materials), and it increases exponentially when teachers and administrators and parents are added as stakeholders in the mix of end users. But notice that, even with the real, analog-world LEGO kits, there are layers of abstraction and standardization. Standardizing the pin size on the LEGO blocks is generative because it suggests more possibilities for building new stuff out of the LEGOs. Standardizing the pieces to build one specialized model is reductive because it suggests fewer possibilities for building new stuff out of the LEGOs. To find ed tech interoperability standards that are generative rather than reductive, we need to first find the right level of abstraction. What Does Your Space Ship Look Like? This brings us to Tony Bates' third concern: I am becoming increasingly disturbed by the tendency of software engineers to force humans to fit technology systems rather than the other way round (try flying with Easyjet or Ryanair for instance). There may be economic reasons to do this in business enterprises, but we need in education, at least, for the technology to empower learners and teachers, rather than restrict their behaviour to fit complex technology systems. The great thing about social media, and the many software applications that result from it, is its flexibility and its ability to be incorporated and adapted to a variety of needs, despite or maybe even because of its lack of common standards. When I look at EDUCAUSE's specifications for its ïNGDLE-conformant standards', each on its own makes sense, but when combined they become a monster of parts. Do I want teaching decisions influenced by student key strokes or time spent on a particular learning object, for instance? Behind each of these activities will be a growing complexity of algorithms and decision-trees that will take teachers and instructors further way from knowing their individual students and making intuitive and inductive decisions about them. Although humans make many mistakes, they are also able to do things that computers can't. We need technology to support that kind of behaviour, not try to replace it. I read two interrelated concerns here. One is that, generically speaking, humans have a tendency to move too far in the direction of standardizing that which should not be standardized in an effort to achieve scalability of efficiency or one of those other words that would have impressed the steel and railroad magnates of a hundred years ago. This results in systems that are user-unfriendly at best and inhumane at worst. The second, more education-specific concern I'm hearing is that NGDLE as ELI envisions it would feed the beast that is our cultural mythology that education can and should be largely automated, which is pretty much where you arrive if you follow the road of standardization ad absurdam. So again, it comes down to standardizing the right things at the right levels of abstraction so that the standards are generative rather than reductive. I'll give an example of a level of ed tech interoperability that achieves a good level of LEGOicity.[2] Whatever digital learning environment you choose, whether it's next-generation, this-generation, last-generation, or whatever-generation, there's a good chance that you are going to want it to have some sense of ""class-ness"", by which I mean that you will probably want to define a group of people who are in a class. This isn't always true, but it is often true. And once you decide that you need that, you then need to specify who is in the class. That means, for every single class section that needs a sense of group, you need to register those users in the new system. If the system supports multiple classes that the students might be in (like an LMS, for example), then you'll need unique identifiers for the class groups so that the system doesn't get them mixed up, and you will also need human-readable identifiers (which may or may not be unique) so that the humans don't get them mixed up and get lost in the system. Depending on the system, you may also want it to know when the class starts and ends, when it meets, who the teacher is, and so on. Again, not all digital learning environments require this information, but many do, including many that work very differently from each other. Furthermore, trying to move this information manually by, for example, asking your students to register themselves and then join a group themselves isƒchallenging. It makes sense to create a machine-to-machine method for sharing this information (a.k.a. an application programming interface, or API) so that the humans don't have to do the tedious and error-prone manual work, and it makes sense to have this API be standard so that anybody developing a digital learning environment or learning tool anywhere can write one set of integration code and get this information from the relevant university system that has it, regardless of the particular brand or version of the system that the particular university is using. The IMS actually has two different standards„LIS and LTI„that do subsets of this sort of thing in different ways. Each one is useful for a particular and different set of situations, so it's rare that you would be in a position of having to pick between the two. In most cases, one will be obviously better for you than the other. The existence and adoption of these standards are generative, because more people can build their own tools, or next-generation digital learning environments, or whatever, and easily make them work well for teachers and students by saving them from that tedious and frustrating registration and group creation workflow. Notice the level of abstraction we are at. We are not standardizing the learning environment itself. We are standardizing the tools necessary for developers to build a learning environment. But even here, there are layers. Think about your mobile phone. It takes a lot of people with a lot of technical expertise a lot of time to build a mobile phone operating system. It takes a single 12-year-old a day to build a simple mobile phone app. This is one reason why there are only a few mobile phone operating systems which all tend to be similar while there are many, many, mobile apps that are very different from each other. Up until now, building digital learning environments has been more like building operating systems than like building mobile apps. When my colleagues and I were thinking about SUNY's digital learning environment needs back in 2005, we wanted to create something we called a Learning Management Operating System (LMOS), but not because we thought that either learning management or operating systems were particularly sexy. To the contrary, we wanted to standardize the unsexy but essential foundations upon which a million billion sexy learning apps could be built by others. Try to remember what your smart phone was like before you installed any apps on it. Pretty boring, right? But it was just the right kind of standardized boring stuff that enabled such miracles of modern life as Angry Birds and Instragram. That's what we wanted, but for teaching and learning. Toward University APIs Let's break this down some more. Have you ever seen one of these sorts of prompts on your smart phone? I bet that you have. This is one of those incredibly unsexy layers of standardization that makes incredibly sexy things happen. It enables my LinkedIn Connected app to know who I just met with and offer to make a connection with them. It lets any new social service I join know who I already know and therefore who I might want to connect with on that service. It lets the taxicab I'm ordering know where to pick me up. It lets my hotel membership apps find the nearest hotel for me. And so on. But there's something weird going on in this screen grab. Fantastical, which is a calendar app, is asking permission to access my calendar. What's up with that? Apple provides a standard Calendar app that isƒwellƒnot terribly impressive. But that's not what this dialog box is referring to. Apple also has an underlying calendaring API and data store, which is confusingly also named Calendar. It is this latter piece of unsexy but essential infrastructure that Fantastical is asking to access. It is also the unsexy piece of infrastructure that makes all the scheduling-related sexiness happen across apps. It's the lingua franca for scheduling. Now imagine a similar distinction between a rather unimpressive Discussions app within an LMS and a theoretical Discussions API in an LMOS. Most discussion apps have certain things in common. There are posts by authors. There are subjects and bodies and dates and times to those posts. Sometimes there are attachments. There are replies which form threads. Sometimes those threads branch. Imagine that you have all of that abstracted into an API or service. You could do a lot of things with it. For starters, you could build a different or better discussion board, the way Fantastical has done on top of Apple's Calendar API. It could be a big thing that has all kinds of cool extra features, or it could be a little thing that, for example, just lets you attach a discussion thread anywhere on any page. Maybe you're building an art history image annotation app and want to be able to hang a discussion thread off of particular spots on the image. Wouldn't it be cool if you didn't have to build all that discussion stuff yourself, but could just focus on the parts that are specific to your app? Maybe you're not building something that needs a discussion thread at all but rather something that could use the data from the discussions app. Maybe you want to build a ""Find a Study Buddy"" app, and you want that app to suggest people in your class that you have interacted with frequently in class discussions. Or maybe you're building an analytics app that looks at how often and how well students are using the class discussions. There's a lot you could do if this infrastructure were standardized and accessible via an API. An LMOS is really a university API for teaching- and learning-relevant data and functionality, with a set of sample apps built on top of that API. What's valuable about this approach is that it can support and enable many different kinds of digital learning environments. If you want to build a super-duper adaptive-personalized-watching-every-click thing, an LMOS should make that easier to do. If you want to build a post-edupunk-open-ed-only-nominally-institutional thing, then an LMOS should make it easier to do that too. You can build whatever you need more quickly and easily, which means that you are more likely to build it. Done right, an LMOS should also support the five attributes that ELI is calling for: Interoperability and Integration Personalization Analytics, Advising, and Learning Assessment Collaboration Accessibility and Universal Design An LMOS-like infrastructure doesn't require any of these things. It doesn't require you to build analytics, for example. But by making the learning apps programmatically accessible via APIs, it makes analytics feasible if analytics are what you want. It is the roughly the right level of abstraction. It is also roughly where we are headed, at least from a technical perspective. Returning to the earlier question of ""at what price standards,"" I believe that we have most or all of the essential technical interoperability standards we need to build an LMOS right now. Yes, there are a couple of interesting standards-in-development that may add further value, and yes, we will likely discover further holes that need to be filled here and there, but I think we have all the basic parts that we need. This is in part due to the fact that, with IMS's new Caliper standard, we have yet another level of abstraction that makes it very flexible. Building on the previous discussion service example, Caliper lets you define a profile for a discussion, which is really just a formalization of all the pieces that you want to share„subject, body, author, time stamp, reply, thread, etc. You can also define a profile for, say, a note-taking app that re-uses the same Caliper infrastructure. If you come up with a new kind of digitally mediated learning interaction in a new app, you can develop a new Caliper profile for it. You might start by developing it just for your own use and then eventually submit it to the IMS for ratification as an official standard when there is enough demand to justify it. This also dramatically reduces the size of the negotiation that has to happen at the standards-making table and therefore improves both speed and quality of the output. Toward a Personal API I hope that I have addressed Tony Bates' concerns, but I'm pretty sure that I haven't gotten to the core of Jim Groom's yet. Jim wants students to own their learning infrastructure, content, and identity as much as possible. And by ""own,"" he means that quite literally. He wants them to have their own web domains where the substantial majority of their digital learning lives resides permanently. To that end, he has started thinking about what he calls a Personal API: [W]hat if one's personal domain becomes the space where students can make their own calls to the University API? What if they have a personal API that enables them to decide what they share, with whom, and for how long. For example, what if you had a Portfolio site with a robust API (which was the use case we were discussing) that was installed on student's personal domain at portfolio.mydomain.com, and enabled them to do a few basic things via API: It called the University API and populated the students classes for that semester. It enabled them to pull in their assignments from a variety of sources (and even version them). it also let them ""submit"" those assignment to the campus LMS. This would effectively be enabling the instructor to access and provide feedback that the student would now have as metadata on that assignment in their portfolio. It can also track course events, discussions, etc. This is very consistent with the example I gave in my 2005 blog post about how a student's personal blog could connect bi-directionally with an LMOS: Suppose that, in addition to having students publish information into the course, the service broker also let the course publish information out to the student's personal data store (read ""portfolio""). Imagine that for every content item that the student creates and owns in her personal area?blog posts, assignment drafts in her online file storage, etc.?there is also a data store to which courses could publish metadata. For example, the grade book, having recorded a grade and a comment about the student's blog post, could push that information (along with the post's URL as an identifier) back out to the student's data store. Now the student has her professor's grade and comment (in read-only format, of course), traveling with her long after the system administrator closed an archived the Psych 101 course. She can publish that information to her public e-portfolio, or not, as she pleases. Fortuitously, this vision is also highly consistent with the fundamental structure that underlies IMS Caliper. Caliper is federated. That is, it assumes that there are going to be different sources of authority for different (but related) types of content, and that there will be different sharing models. So it is very friendly to world in which students own some data and universities own other data and could provide the ""facade"" necessary for the communication between the two world. So again, we have roughly the right level of abstraction to be generative rather than reductive. Caliper can support both a highly scaffolded and data-driven adaptive environment and a highly decentralized and extra-institutional environment. And, perhaps best of all, it lets us get to either incrementally by growing an ecosystem piece by piece rather than engineering a massive and monolithic platform. Nifty, huh? Believe it or not, none of this is the hard part. The hard part is the cultural and institutional barriers that prevent people from demanding the change that is very feasible from a technical perspective. But that's another blog post (or fifty) for another time."""
